Two things.

1) Music from the Eighties sucks because of North Americans' poor response to Nancy Reagan and her message of denial.  England had all that punk and some fucking wave of ska.  NA had Bananrama.  "Let's repress anything that we might actually have to say because we're scared of our president and his wife, who our parents thought were kind of neat.  And if we want to learn anything from overseas, let's just take shitty europop so that someday we can look back and be completely embarrassed about what the fuck we listened to in the name of rebellion and freedom of thought and speech and all that shit."  That was the North American response for ten years.  A decade.  One third of a lot of a century.

2) Daredevil was (apart from the fight sequence in the church which needed three more months of work [that they couldn't have 'cause then it would have been going head to head with X2]} way better than Spiderman.  Same kind of shitty soundtrack though.
