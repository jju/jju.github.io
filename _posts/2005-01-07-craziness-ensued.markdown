Make that 14 hours after all the paperwork was done.  I needed 3 copies of all the class lists and blank exams and answer keys and all this extra crap.  Which meant I had to make an answer key that might withstand a tiny bit of scrutiny.    
  
It was pretty ridiculous in the English office this morning.  
  
Still nobody to help me buy a ticket from CQ to Lhasa. Everybody's in the middle of exams and are really busy.  I'm thinking I might just go to Chongqing where the travel agents might speak a bit of English.
