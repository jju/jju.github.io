So I have worked.  It's really pretty simple since they won't give me the "difficult" areas like childrens' books to reshelve for a couple of weeks.  The thing that I loved about it is how quickly the time went.  Actually having a trolley full of books that you're putting away is beautiful.  You just find things until you're done, and then when you are done, there are more books to do it again.  
  
This is really the same thing as what you do as a journalist.  You reorganize information so it's where people can find it.  You put it away.  You're sweeping and letting your mind wander.  Who knew library cookbooks were so popular?  You're shovelling snow.  Y'know, cultural snow.
