I am half-heartedly going through my PowerBook, preparing it to be Linux-ized. Not because it really needs to be; I just feel like having a project to work on. I've never had a computer that both functioned and wasn't being used regularly. There is nothing Linux will do for it that it can't do already. Just to see if I can make it work. And it's helping divert my new phone desire. Now that the GooglePhone is in Canada I'm having to stave off envious thoughts. It has a keyboard, which I find I miss from my old Treo.
