Today J-Dog and I went out and played catch.  I refuse to believe that all the horrible noises my throwing shoulder made were because of age.  I know they were from disuse and laziness, but it was tempting to say "Man, I'm getting old."  Fear not, I didn't actually say it.  I've got like ten years before I can even start to think about the age excuse.  I feel sorry for people who are 25 and are growing up like that, and I know it happens.  But I will not let my body get in the way of me having a good time.
  

  
And now for [something vaguely related](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06012005):

<blockquote>You don't understand man! That medallion has hell of properties! . . . It belonged to King Chochacho, the Fun God.
  

  
"King Chochacho?"
  

  
He's unusual in religious folklore, as he mainly liked to kick around and talk shit with his friends.  He didn't do much God stuff.  In fact, many tales describe him as getting pissed when the people would ask him to make the chickens fatter or whatever!</blockquote>

If I ever become fantastically wealthy by selling my soul to have killer chops at the piano I swear upon all that is profane in this world that I will be as much like [Ray Smuckles](http://raysmuckles.blogspot.com/) as it is possible for someone who is not [a cartoon cat](http://www.achewood.com) to be.
  

  
A quote from Ray about his pool boy: 

<blockquote>"The kid smiles even after he says 'good morning!' and gets back into his work. I'll go back inside while he's smilin' at his scrub brush or whatever, and maybe get some fresh shorts outta the dryer, then look slyly out the window and he'll still be smilin' away like a nut. Shit drives me crazy at 9am when all I want in the world is to be left alone with my Bloody Mary and morning calamari. To have a young man constantly smiling at you is no way to live."</blockquote>

Preach it brother.
