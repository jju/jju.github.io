Alison is so good. Tonight she reattached the cuff of the sweetass yellow leather jacket that used to be Reyn's dad's that Reyn's arms were too long to fit. So now I have the jacket and can use its powers for good.

Also, more irons have been added to the fire. That's all I can say about that right now. *Mysterious!*
