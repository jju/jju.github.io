I'm listening to Dylan Thomas and I've spilled hot chocolate all over myself.  Not from awe at the poetry, but through a door that wasn't latched as tight as I'd imagined.  He's talking about snowballs and uncles and dog whistles.  I'm glad I waited to listen to it till now, even though the CD arrived months ago.    
  
The only thing I remembered about A Child's Christmas in Wales is that Jake Pankratz made us watch it (at least) once and that Carrie Fisher was in it.
