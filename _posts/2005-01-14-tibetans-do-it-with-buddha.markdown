I am a circumambulating machine.  You need something walked around?  Let me know.  I do temples, parks, palaces you name it.

I was pretty sure I was being tested by clever monks today trying to get into the Potala Palace.  Every entrance I tried I was sent further down the line till I could no longer even see the giant symbol of Lhasa.  I figured I'd just keep on circling until someone let me in.  That's what the monks needed to do to be trained at the cool temples right?

When I did get inside I was vaguely disappointed.  There were some wicked mandalas, but they were all gold, not sand.  I am beginning to despair of seeing a sand mandala in its natural habitat.

(Just in case you're wondering about the posting everyday-ness (doesn't he have better things to do in Tibet?), I'll remind you it's freaking cold outside so twenty minutes in a room hot with cigarette smoke and computers running CounterStrike can be just the thing.)
