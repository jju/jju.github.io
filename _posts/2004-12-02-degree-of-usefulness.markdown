I just got back from dinner with Alex.  He was in Chongqing this past week at the huge job fair, looking for a hotel job.  He's graduating with his Tourism degree this year.  I don't know how it works everywhere else in the world, but that degree gets him an interview to be a waiter at the Hilton.  
  

  
In Canada is that where you'd start even with a degree?  I seem to remember Andrei working at Winnipeg nice hotels without any degree.  And what about Lori?  I'm sure she did something in the hospitality industry, cause Reyn kept scamming a gym pass.
  

  
Alex is now dapper in his golden sweater and suitjacket whose pinstripes match it.  The interview is on Monday.  He's excited, especially since he's competing against people from key universities, and our school is decidedly un-key.  I hope it goes okay.  At least in part because I'd rather listen to him gloat about how he's better than the English majors than whine about how he isn't appreciated by the English majors.
