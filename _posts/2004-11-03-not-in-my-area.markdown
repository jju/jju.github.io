This isn't the three gorges but it's still interesting.

[Farmers protest China dam.](http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,76510,00.html)


<blockquote>POLICE in southwest China beat one man to death during a rally attended by thousands of farmers.

They were protesting against the building of a massive dam that will force them from their homes.

More than 100,000 villagers from three townships affected by the Pubugou dam in Sichuan province's Hanyuan county descended on the dam's construction site on Wednesday, reported Hong Kong's Apple Daily.

The protests peaked last Friday when locals marched on the Hanyuan county government offices carrying the corpse of a dead protester, Hong Kong's Sun Daily said.</blockquote>
