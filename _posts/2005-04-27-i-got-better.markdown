I gave a lecture yesterday evening after spending my day feeling kind of sick and crappy.  But the lecture was about comics (ie something I was actually interested in talking about) so I slept all afternoon to get ready for it.
  

  
It went fairly well.  My angle (which couldn't be too specific for this kind of lecture which is open to all sorts of students) was that comics are for adults too.  Wowee wow, earthshattering I know, but hey.
  

  
The best part was when I was answering questions.  One freshman asked if I thought that the superhero idea of one guy saving the world influenced the american invasion of Iraq.  They'd asked about some differences between cultures and comics and things before that but this actually built on the answers that I'd been giving.  It's too bad the student that asked it never does his homework.  (For the record, I said that there wasn't a causal relationship, but a parallelism that could be pretty striking, that both superheroes and cowboy diplomacy were reflections of a deeper psychological issue.  It got kind of abstract so I doubt that many people got it.  I'm not sure if I got it.)
  

  
And don't worry, the writeup about last week in the park with the erhuers is coming.  I had other more pressing and better paying things to work on the past couple of days, plus I was sick.
