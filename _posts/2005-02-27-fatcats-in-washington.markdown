I'm preparing for my American culture class tomorrow and that involves skimming through the book.  Here's a choice bit about social problems like violence discrimination and decaying morality in America:

<blockquote>In this capitalist society, although science and technology is highly advanced, some people are suffering from spiritual hollowness.  Thus they start to look for things curious and exciting.  Therefore, only when the American capitalist system is ended, can all these social problems be solved.</blockquote>

The section on the American political system spends a lot of time attacking the bourgeoisie overlords.  I feel like I'm reading a Green Arrow comic.  
  
If anyone out there's feeling bored and wants to look up what a North American textbook says about how to solve all of China's ills, I'd appreciate being sent a slice for contrast/comparison purposes.
