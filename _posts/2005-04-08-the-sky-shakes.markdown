I've been [there](http://www.cbc.ca/cp/world/050407/w040776.html).  No bombs went off at that time.
  

  
It feels like summer here.  It's been hot the last couple of days and we're getting thundershowers.  It's awesome.  On Wednesday we had some great thunder in the middle of class and I had to go off on a digression about how much I love thunder.  It sort of connected because they'd been reading about the difference between climate and weather.
