To continue a bit on the theme of pirates, I got the DVD of Kill Bill Vol. 2 yesterday.  I made a promise to myself that it was the only exception to the rule that I'm not going to buy any movie here that I've already seen.  We'll see how that goes since I pass by all the Lord of the Rings every single day.  
  

  
But KB2 was great including the one little weird thing about this version: No English subtitles for the Pai Mei sequence.  I remembered how it went so it wasn't a huge deal, and it's not like the KB movies have the same sparkling memorable dialogue that made Tarantino's other flicks so eminently watchable ("Then why'd you try to fuck him like a bitch?").  
  

  
I turned my laptop into a region-free DVD player because my Wang Jia Wei (Chinese name for Wong Kar Wai) collection is Region 3 instead of Region All like Chinese DVDs are supposed to be.
