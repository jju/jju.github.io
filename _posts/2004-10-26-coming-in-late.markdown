I only started listening to John Peel's radio show in the past year.  [Some](http://www.diepunyhumans.com/) say he's the world's greatest music broadcaster.  And now he's [dead](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3955289.stm).  
  
Listening to: **Wave Of Mutilation** from the album At The BBC   
by [The Pixies](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pixies%22)
