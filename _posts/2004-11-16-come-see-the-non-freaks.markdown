The Boston Globe had a little piece called [How Dungeons changed the world](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/11/15/dungeons_and_dragons_we_love_you/).  It doesn't actually go that far.  But it's a nice little _mainstream_ article that should really be posted in every game store to show concerned parents.
