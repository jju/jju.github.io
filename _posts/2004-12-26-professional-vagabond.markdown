I have to teach my newspaper classes again this week.  I can't remember how I do those classes.  Especially since there are only two or three of them to get them prepared for the exam.  My expectations for them have been lowered a lot by the second-years, which I don't think is fair to these students.  I have to figure out what we're going to do in these classes.

But it means in two weeks I'll be done my first semester as a teacher and can leave for Tibet.  There I'll follow my true calling of wandering around someplace new.  After I get my January paycheque.
