So yes, Special Services is a different kind of place to work than Intrepid. Just different clientele I guess. Did you know that we routinely are asked for space to pray? One of the young men who asked yesterday was obviously there doing homework or something, but I wonder if the older gentleman was just in the area and knew the library would have space for him.

It's almost the end of March and I'm still shivering. I'm trying not to get angry about the cold and the snow again. I really am. It's only -9. That's not that cold comparatively. But I can't remember a time when I could sit in my living room alone in any sort of comfort. Or have the doors between rooms be open. I hate this compartmentalization I need to do to keep warm. And it feels like I've been doing this my entire time living here. Summer is too fucking short to make up for all this bullshit.

It doesn't help that I have my weather reports set up to show me what it's like where my friends live. 19 in LA, 21 in Chengdu (as close to Nanchong as Yahoo weather gets me), 11 in London. At least Calgary's cold today too.  I should really move somewhere I don't spend six months of the year complaining about the weather.
