I'm feeling much better these days.  Mucus is just flowing out of my face holes, so I should be good to leave for Hong Kong (and Macau) this weekend.  Sorry I haven't had anything really interesting to say.  I've been lying around reading and playing video games.  For interest's sake The Bard's Tale has the best script and voice acting of any video game I've ever played.
