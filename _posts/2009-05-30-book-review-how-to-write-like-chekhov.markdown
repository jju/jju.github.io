I received [How to Write Like Chekhov](http://www.amazon.ca/How-Write-Like-Chekhov-Inspiration/dp/1569242593/) from Aileen as part of her effort to incubate within me a Russian soul. I don't think it's done that but it was a fine book of writing advice pulled from his letters. The second half of the book is a travelogue sort of thing about Sakhalin, an island prison colony. It's lined with notes on technique for research and everything else. As always I wonder how good the translation is, especially when he's talking about simplicity of language. I can't stop myself from wondering about the equivalence of simplicity between Russian and English. But yes, it'll be a good book for going back to, I think.
