84
  

  
The Syrian visas should be on their way back.  My mom was busy giving herself heart attacks the other day by reading all the travel advisories for the countries that Ren and I are going to.  Sigh.  I warned her not to do that kind of thing.  Now she's worried about us stepping on landmines and attending demonstrations that will get us killed.  I explained that those are just propagated by people who are very interested in not looking responsible if we should somehow find a way to die in a far off land.  Now they can say "We warned you that three toed camels had acid spit that could kill you and you shouldn't come within three thousand miles!  Don't blame us!"
  

  
I watched the director's commentary on the Memento special edition tonight, finally.  The end of the commentary completely changes the way I have to look at how I've watched the movie.  Which is really good.
  

  
G'night.
