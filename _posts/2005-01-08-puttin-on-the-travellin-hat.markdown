Alright, new plan.  Tomorrow I'm getting on a sleeper bus to Chengdu.  From there it is very easy to get flights to Lhasa (and travel agents are recommended in Let's Go China).  
  
I realized that I'd been looking at this all wrong, trying to get help from students and things so I could get things planned here.  I'd forgotten that I'm not a teacher until the end of February and can now get into the traveller mindset that got Reyn and me through so many excellent times with limited (ie 0) local language skills.  You go somewhere and then somewhere else and if things don't work where you are you go somewhere new.    
  
Like Chandigarh.  Stupid city.  I'm so glad we cut our losses on that one.  Or the Cairo Sheraton (may they all be destroyed).  
  
I realize that's a tourist (though I prefer the term pilgrim) mindset and it might be better to try doing things as if I actually lived here or was trying to understand the culture in deeper yadda yadda yadda.  But if I'm not going to have any fun with that, why bother?  
  
Sometimes I wish I had Nowhere Near Barstow (my journal from the trip with Reyn) here.  Reading some of that again would have shaken me out of this crappiness about travel and language problems that I've been feeling lately.
