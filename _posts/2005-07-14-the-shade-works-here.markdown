Yesterday was a lazy day in Turpan's heat.  We didn't do much at all, except hang out in air conditioned places.  
  
Like the Turpan museum where they had prehistoric rhino fossils and a dozen mummies.  They draped red cloths over the crotch areas of all but the most clothed corpses.  One mummy still had his dreadlocks and beard, even though his jaw was sort of dislocated.  These were all presumably accidental mummies from around 500-700CE.  Their skin was stretched leather, but a couple of the females still appeared fat.  There were also two babies.  The tiniest one must have been completely new born, but it only had a slight papering of skin.  The other was older aaand had a very peaceful but eerie expression.  
  
Then last night we ran into some of our friends from the yurt.  We took the bus to the train station together and while they engaged in a flurry of food gathering, we had a leisurely supper of banmian and grapes.  
  
The train got in this morning a bit before nine but then it was two hour bus ride from the Dunhuang train station to Dunhuang.  I guess it's a prestige thing that puts the Dunhuang name on some other town's train station and prevents them from saying that Dunhuang doesn't actually have a train station of its own.  
  
Now we're trying to figure out how we'll keep moving on from here since Holly hasn't heard back from her friend in Xian yet.  But before we leave there are grottoes and sand sledding to do.
