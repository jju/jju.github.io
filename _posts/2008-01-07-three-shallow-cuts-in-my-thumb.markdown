Last night I was at Reyn's new place and I like it. Hardwood floors, trim around the doors, a charmingly awkward layout. It seems pretty nice. The kind of place I'd want to live in were I to be suddenly evacuated from Alison's house.

Today at work there was a note from some superiors complaining about the misfiled books in the 613s and 615s. These issues have been there for months upon month, but I heard a couple of the new pages sounding a little worried as they signed in. The sheer pointlessness of our jobs hasn't sunk into them yet. Books will always be out of order and we will always be putting them back and it will always be less efficient than some would prefer.

In April when I get back from China I'm going to have to start applying for better jobs in this system again. Not that my life will be complete if I become a part-time LSA, but to do something different. This whole "not going to Egypt because MCC suddenly wants a real teacher" thing has got me all messed up because I really like term positions. I like having countdowns going. I was really looking forward to these being my last two months putting books on shelves. Just like by the end of three years in Cairo I would have been really looking forward to coming back to Canada. But this endless churn without a reset button is demoralizing. 

And the fact that I have to _ask_ for a leave in March rather than _tell_ them I'm leaving, well that sucks too. I really really hate being reliant on the kindness of my superiors.

Last night Steve was saying how he didn't get the Mennonite urge to leave home for however many years at a time (as Reyn's parents are about to do). And I'm completely one of them. The good thing is that there are plenty of songs that romanticize that feeling of not being at home when you're at home. I like songs that are sort of about me. 

This whole living here without an endpoint in sight just gets me nauseous. When I get back from my China trip I wonder how long it'll be before leaving becomes an urgent priority again.
