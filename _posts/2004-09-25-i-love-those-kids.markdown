You know how sometimes a person is insanely lucky for no reason at all (hence the insanely lucky bit)?  This morning searching around the BBC site for some information on British science I happened to wonder about the good old Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  So I surfed on over and was falbbergasted to find that they are adapting the last three books as radio shows!  You can find more information at [BBC - Radio 4 - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - The New Series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/newseries.shtml)  They just started and only rerun each episode on the internet for a week.  So I grabbed my minidsic recorder and am making mp3s of each episode to go with my original series.
  

  
It's great, I have something to look forward to every week!  And they just started so I didn't miss any episodes.  Hooray for everything.
