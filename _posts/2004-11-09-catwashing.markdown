So in Nanchong there are a couple of universities that have teachers from our organization.  They are both close to each other and there's a big nice park between them.   
  
One university had very clean cats.  You can't see them in this picture but next to these women was a big crate with about thirty dirty kittens that these women would clean and then set free to hunt gigantic rats.  There was another couple of women cleaning the rats in much the same way.  Or not.  
  
We were there for thanksgiving (late for Canada early for the States) and it was fine, though perhaps a bit scheduled.  At one point we were supposed to go around with a quick summary of where we taught what we taught and the best/worst thing that's happened this term.  Quick like that.  No one did a nice quick summary.  It's like everyone wanted to tell their stories filled with all that complex language you can't really use as a teacher (if you want your students to understand you that is).  
  
We ate a big meal with chicken and stuffing (made in rice cookers) and sweet potates and pie and such.  I didn't need to eat again till supper the next day.  Then we watched [Dogville](http://imdb.com/title/tt0276919/) which was excellent.  
  
On Sunday I went to Guangan, Deng Xiao Ping's birth place.  There was an excellent museum that had things like the last three cigarettes left in the pack when he quit smoking.  They were Panda brand, if you want to do some reform and opening up in your lungs.
