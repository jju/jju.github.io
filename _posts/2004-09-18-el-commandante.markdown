Blogger has been pissing me off a bit again, so I'm trying out a program called  [Ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/)  to help me not get so frustrated.  **Update** Ecto sucks at working with Blogger unless you're running OSX Panther.  In case you care.
  

  
The other reason I haven't posted anything is cause I've been busy having wild adventures.  No.  I haven't.  I've just been teaching and things.  But yesterday I was "an honoured guest" at the presentation of how militarily trained the freshmen now are.  We sat on the platform and watched 1600 kids goosestep by and practice falling over and fake punching people.  Then the real soldiers came out and we saw a lot of high kicking and formation tackling.  I videotaped some of it.  Not the high kicking, but lots of raggedy feet in multicoloured sneakers marching by.  I just need a bigger hard drive (and my power cord for my camera) to make a little piece of Sino-fascist propaganda (which is what one reviewer called Hero.  Hmph.)
