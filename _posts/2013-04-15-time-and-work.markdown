Yesterday I watched a documentary about the Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei. The scenes where he was in Chengdu made me miss China. Not that I was especially happy when I was living in China, but visiting China after my term was done? I loved it.

Maybe I just miss being on vacation. I know from Australia that working five days a week wears me down. After easter I was joking with some of my coworkers about how I could get used to that 3-day work week/4-day weekend cycle. But it wasn't a joke exactly. I totally wish my job was a (predictable) part time one. Especially here in Campbell River where I do not need to be working as much as I do to pay my rent (as opposed to Vancouver or Sydney).

I mean, I like making enough money I don't have to put off buying groceries till my paycheque comes in. I don't want to make less per hour, just work less. Socking money away in a bank account is something I'll appreciate eventually (when Aileen and I hit the trans-siberian for example), but for now it's not exactly providing a huge amount of pleasure for me the way lazy long weekends do.

But I have vacation time coming, and I'm taking it in San Francisco. The Jays are playing two games against the Giants the first week of June and I'll be there. I bought tickets yesterday and had to fight very hard to not spend hundreds of dollars on each one. 

I got one seat behind the plate-ish along the home-3rd base line (which is my favourite place to watch a ballgame from even if it is thirty rows further up from where I'd get them at a Goldeyes game), and the other by the Giants bullpen lined up along the 2nd-3rd basepath. I'm hoping Lawrie's back with the big club and isn't injured so I can watch him do his thing fairly closely. It's too bad about Reyes' ankle injury.

Sometimes I think about my time here in Campbell River being something like my time in Wanzhou. When I do that it feels more manageable. I mean, I couldn't possibly go to San Francisco for a week or Vancouver for a weekend from Wanzhou. And I made it through those years all right. But I worked a lot less as a mediocre teacher. 

Sigh.

That's my infrequent update on what is happening in my non-reading life. (For my reading life, as always check [Librarianaut](http://librarianaut.com))
