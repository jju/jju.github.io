Yesterday was awesome.  It rained (like poured (like cats, dogs and fish sucked out of the ocean)) in the early afternoon which cooled everything off and cleared up the sky.  I went to a park with Holly and watched kite flyers and pingpong players and read and everything was really sweet.  It was enough to make you forget the pain of tones and z's and c's that sound almost but not quite exactly the same.  Today it's cloudy again but not quite as oppressively muggy as it has been.
