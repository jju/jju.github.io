I went to the fried jiaozi place tonight and it wasn't very busy.  Probably the rain.  The guy who I always order from was feeling talkative which is always very frustrating for me.  I don't talk to people well at the best of times and much less so in Chinese.  But after a little while of fruitless obvious things which are all I can ever remember when I'm out in the world he pulled out a little three stringed mandolinish thing and played.  The first song was Happy Birthday, but then he was just playing and it was good.  He'd interrupt with a question and I wished he'd shut up so I could keep listening to something I understood.
