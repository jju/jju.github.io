It's possible you've noticed that [Campaign Outfitters](http://www.campaignoutfitters.ca) has closed down.  I'm sort of ashamed for only noticing a week ago, but Pembina & Grant is further from my usual domain than it used to be.  In any case, they're reopening in the Exchange under a new name, [Imagine Games and Hobbies](http://imaginegames.ca/) in February.  So yes, if you're keeping track that's a new owner (a couple of years ago), new location, new name.  The continuity is striking, like one of those three thousand year old temples that's been burned down seventeen times in its history, including in 1968, and moved out of the way of a hydroelectric dam, yet still draws in the tourists.  I'll probably keep on calling it Campaign.  Comics America is still Styx to me.
