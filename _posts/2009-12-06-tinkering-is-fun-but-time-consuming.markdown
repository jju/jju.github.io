I've gone back to trying to get Linux onto my old PowerBook. It is a challenge. A fiddly fiddly challenge. Right now I'm stuck at the point where the PowerBook's internal CD-Drive doesn't want to cooperate as a bootable device. It will only boot from an old OSX 10.2 CD, not from my 10.5 nor my newly burnt Linux discs. That drive has given me a lot of grief in the last 5 years so I might go on eBay for a $50 replacement. Eventually. This is just something to do for the sake of trying to do it, so timelines aren't real important.
