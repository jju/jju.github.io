A Chinese non-paralyzed version of Steven Fletcher bouncing a basketball with total deliberation while walking down a tiled Beijing sidewalk at 10 pm.  Like his head bobbed up and down watching the ball as he bounced it from about head height.  No matter their evil power, at least crippled MPs can't do that.
