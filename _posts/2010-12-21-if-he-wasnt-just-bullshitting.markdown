Two nights ago a Texan yoga instructor was at the bakery. He was talking about working in a couple of Indian vegetarian cafes back in Dallas in the nineties. He wasn't into yoga at the time but the owners brought in yoga teachers and speakers from time to time. There was also a guy who came in all the time who wanted to make movies, who loved the owner and the owner's son. When he became a filmmaker he cast the Indian guys in his movies whenever possible. And that's as close as I come to being an acquaintance of [Wes Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Anderson) (and [Kumar Pallana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar_Pallana)).
