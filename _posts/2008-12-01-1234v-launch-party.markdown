Have you read anything interesting about vaginas recently? Would you like to go to a party where they will be discussed loudly und mit feeling? Erm, not actually feeling the vaginas... this came out wrong. Read the poster.[caption id="attachment_1554" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="1234V Launch Party Poster"][![1234V Launch Party Poster](http://hungryj.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/1234v-launch-two.png?w=300)](http://hungryj.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/1234v-launch-two.png)[/caption]

Sarah (and company) have gone and edited up another issue of everyone's favourite vajournal, 1234V, and they're having a launch party on December 27th at The Royal Albert. DJs I know will be spinning records. One of them is even a boy! Also, you know who wrote a story for this issue? Little old me. It's a tale of Science!

So yes, come to the launch party. It will be fun. I'm going straight there from the classy Xmas party at my mom's house.
