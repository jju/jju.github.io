The Rev* and I have returned from the travel agents with the promise of bounteous booty, hooray!  Despite the coolness factor it would have had, we will not be leaving on September 11th, but the 12th.  We shall return (in MacArthurlike fashion) at the end of March in 2003.  Hoo-hah.  Now all we have to do is the visas and shots and suchlike.  No problem.
  

  
*I figure Ren deserves some sort of a title with his CMU theology BA.
