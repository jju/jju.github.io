Last Saturday I was over at Alison's helping her and Dr. Foster drink some beers and watch some British television. When I got home, not drunk, but having had a few beers, I sat down at the computer and thought "I should really own [Diaspora](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2009/02/08/book-review-diaspora/)." And I popped it into my Amazon.ca cart. "Sweet!" I thought, "Free shipping!" and I put the order through. Amazon remembers my credit card number and address, but I don't have one-click shopping enabled. I went to bed nice and happy.

On Sunday morning I woke up thinking "Did I order books last night?" So I checked my Amazon history and sure enough I had. The funny part is that I'd had a couple of books sitting in my cart from before when I did my not paying too much attention Saturday night order so I would be getting a big ol' shipment instead of just one book (this was why it was free shipping with me only adding Diaspora). Happily none of the books in the cart were like hundred dollar monstrosities, so it was a manageable surprise. They showed up yesterday and I experienced no buyer's remorse, especially since today was pay day. Though I'm going to clear my cart in the future.
