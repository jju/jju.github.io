[Aide for Times Revealed Secrets, China Charges](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/22/international/asia/22china.html?adxnnl=1&oref=login&adxnnlx=1098493627-p3Q4fwK1GNWT8/MvFbTQJg)(NYTimes registration required): 

<blockquote>"The Chinese authorities have formally arrested a researcher in the Beijing bureau of The New York Times on charges of revealing   state secrets to foreigners. 
  

  
The researcher, Zhao Yan, who was detained Sept. 17 on suspicion of that   crime, has not been allowed to see his lawyer or relatives. Charges under the stringent state security law were filed Wednesday, according to a notice received by Mr. Zhao's family, but no details of his misdeeds he has been charged with have been disclosed. Formal arrest on security charges, in the Chinese criminal system, is a major step toward a secret trial and virtually certain conviction, with a long  prison sentence possible."</blockquote>


  

  
Umm yeah.  My boss has also mentioned that maybe I should keep a lower profile for a while.  So the blog is about to go back to food and teaching and pictures of happy things.  Happy happy things.
