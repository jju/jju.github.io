The Departed, one of my favourite movies of 2006, has been banned in China!  [From the CBC:](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/01/20/thedeparted-china.html)

<blockquote>Reports from China say the movie was blocked because of a plot line in which Boston gangsters are shown trying to sell military computer hardware to Chinese villains.</blockquote>

I find it funny that the story refers to the movie's Chinese as villains.  I can't remember any moustache twirling.  In fact, they're pretty much a MacGuffin.  Their entire scene consists of Jack Nicholson being a prick (through a translator, who I imagine edits out the more offensive epithets - I think they were speaking Cantonese or enough slang that I could follow nothing) and then them purchasing a briefcase.  They don't even shoot anyone.  
  
It's so sad that none of my friends in China will get to see this wonderful crime drama now that it's been banned.  If only there was some intrepid capitalist hero who could get a copy into the country on some sort of device that could be copied and sold for a modest fee.  
  
Oh wait.
