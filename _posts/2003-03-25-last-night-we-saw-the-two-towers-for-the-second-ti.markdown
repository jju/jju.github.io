Last night we saw _The Two Towers_ for the second time (at least for me and Ren; I think Sean said it was his 4th).  It is amazing how much better that movie is when it isn't a shitty pirated copy recorded from somewhere on the left side of the theatre.  This time we actually got to see Aragorn "die" (the copy in Dharamsala was skipping mightily at that point so we got to see fighting with wild riders, lots of jumbled up fractions of seconds, and then Legolas getting mad at Theoden for ordering the dead to be left behind.  And of course it was fun making jokes about the Entmoot and how Beech and Ash were always such assholes about vetoes and such.
  

  
Did anyone read the Gordon Sinclair thing in the Winnipeg Free Press today?  It was a big fat piece of infuriating "stay in Winnipeg" propaganda.  Mrmf.  Winnipeg came across as Westgate writ large.  All warm fuzzies and you'll never have any friends anywhere else so you'd better not leave.  In unrelated news I'm going to London (*sigh* Ontario) next Wednesday, and then I'm going to swing on out to Ottawa to see Crackeyes and a fatassed fucking dirty cunt bitch from Montreal.
