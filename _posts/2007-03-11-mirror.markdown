I read a book of Haruki Murakami short stories last week.  There is nothing I love better than his stuff.  I mean, seriously, I like to read lots of things but there is nothing I like to read more than something by this man.  You know how they say to write things you'd like to read?  I'm in the process of writing a couple of very Murakamiesque stories.  I hope to get at least one of them completely done up by the time I turn 27.  
  
That would be by Friday.  
  
Today when I got home from playing Necromunda at Dave's I sat on the porch in the last of the day's sun and had a beer.  What sucks about winter: not doing that.
