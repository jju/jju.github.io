Urumqi is way the fuck north of where I normally live in China.  It's summer so the long days are more pronounced the further north you go.  Add to that the fact that this place on the other side of the country from Beijing is on the same time zone.  Then arrive at 4 in the morning with only a bit of airplane sleep and you get a messed up sense of time real quick.  
  
At what felt like noon but was actually 8am we hit the town.  We were trying to find a museum but that failed.  We also failed to find this big park, but we did find the smaller one that had the nice landmark of a mountain sticking out of it.  We climbed it and ran into a soldier who was telling us of the wonders of Tulufan (in Chinese - between Holly and I we can sometimes figure out what people are talking about and then s can respond or I can if it's ridiculously simple).  We had never heard of it.  He asked where we were going next.  We said Kashgar and then to Turpan.  Turpan?  Yeah.  Oh you mean Tulufan.  Mandarin and ighur have different names for all these places, and the guidebooks tend to give the Uighur.  
  
We did some more traipsing in the really long day.  Like seriously, at nine at night the sun's up and it's freaky since Wanzhou isn't like that.  Eventually we bought some train tickets and then tried to find the Uighur quarter.  We eventually found something that looked like a giant important mosque.  We got up close and decided something was wrong because most mosques don't have a KFC and Carrefour in them.  It was actually pretty disturbing the wholesale architectural theft for consumeristic purposes.  I'll talk more about that some other time though.  
  
We've been eating Xinjiang food which consists of lots of nan bread and skewers of lamb.  So good.  At the place on Sunday we were also greatly entertained by our trio of waiters.  Then we went back to the hotel and slept the sleep of the well fed and about to go see some nature.
