I am always completely amazed at how much better I feel when I have written. Today I finished off the first draft of a cataloguing paper (about the challenges of cataloguing webcomics) and while it's nothing crazy impressive, I learned some shit and have some stuff written about what I learned. And my mood? So much better than it was yesterday, or all last week when I hadn't written anything on this and was just dreading it.

A while back I was trying to figure out why I was so much less motivated this term with a month left than last term. And the answer was completely to do with the whole leaving for China the day after classes were over. I needed to get everything out of the way so I did. This term there's cool stuff happening after classes are done (going to Vermont and then to Australia), but nothing I **need** to push myself right now for. And no Holly waiting for me right on the other side. (She'll be coming to Oz in July.)

But today I feel good. I wrote [a post for Closed Stacks](http://www.closedstacks.com/?p=3274) (another library blog I'm contributing to) and [a book review](http://librarianaut.com/2011/03/13/book-review-in-the-garden-of-iden/). I've got business cards in the mail. Tonight I'm going to do some real writing. Oh, and Reyn's a dad (I saw it on his sister's Facebook), so congratulations.
