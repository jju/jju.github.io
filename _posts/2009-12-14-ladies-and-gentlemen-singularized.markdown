Today I got to help Crazy Russian Lady find some Italian opera CDs at the library. CRL is kind of disconcerting because she wears these superblack glasses you can feel her staring through. And she wanders off on digressions through European languages I don't speak. And sometimes she just starts laughing in response to one of her own foreign ramblings. So yeah. Usually she deals with Robert, but today he wasn't working (first day off since people decided to walk upright), so she came to me.

She was looking for Italian opera. So I took her to where we have your Verdi and Rossini and Donizetti. Once there she was muttering in probably-Italian, sometimes in an interrogative fashion. I said "I don't understand the words you just said" and she'd repeat herself in mostly-English. She started asking for more specific stuff "from La Scala in Milano" so I took her to the computer and tried making a list. Turns out we don't index where every opera CD we have was recorded. I made a list of compilation CDs that had stuff from Rigoletto and we went to find the discs. Each time I gave her one she'd coo and almost cradle the thing to her chest, babbling away in possibly-Spanish (she'd shifted languages when I gave her a CD by some singer named Alvarez). She'd ask after I pulled each CD "This, this is from the list?" I'd say yes and she'd be happy.

Finally she wanted to know where the Spanish and Italian literature was so I took her over to that section. She also asked if she could keep the list. She stopped to pick up a basket for carrying things and asked me how to make the handles work. I pulled the handles out and she said, "This, this one he knows everything!" and did her unnerving laugh. I escorted her to the sections with the languages she wanted and left her there. She didn't come back to the desk after that. 

Jane'd come to check on if I needed rescuing but I was okay. I fear I just shot up Crazy Russian Lady's list of preferred people at Special Services. And I have only myself to blame. But on the plus side, I managed to avoid 15 minutes of teaching Stoned Guy how to bake bread. Not that baking bread is uninteresting; Stoned Guy is just a really earnest and horrible student.
