We have the Criterion Collection DVD of [Brand Upon the Brain](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443455/) in the system and somehow it made its way out to Intrepid the other day for me to grab up. I felt bad for missing it when it was playing in the city but watching a Guy Maddin with other people around would seem to be a recipe for hearing people be self-important douches as they leave the theatre. Here it was just me and I could like it without having to sound like a douche to anyone. Except you, I guess. I think I'll watch it again tomorrow with a different narrator.
