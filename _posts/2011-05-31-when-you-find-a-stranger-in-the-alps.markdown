My mother is complaining I haven't been blogging enough. This is because she doesn't read [Librarianaut](http://librarianaut.com). Six posts in the last week. That she doesn't care about my topics over there is a completely separate issue. (Hi Mom!)

Recently the exciting secrets I've been keeping from the blog include how I went to get backup keys to my apartment copied, and the place in the mall told me I had to go to a certified locksmith. I suspect that's because these keys have "Do Not Copy" stamped on them.

The other day Javier was playing guitar in the common area. It turns out he knows something like three songs and can spend hours trying to play them correctly.

Friday was the last day at work for one of my coworkers. We went to the fish market for lunch. At the fish market there are very few vegetarian options, which wasn't a problem for me, since I could have a greek salad. But my boss felt bad so he ordered me two salads and potato wedges. It was an amount of salad designed to be ridiculed.

My boss was so happy today when he learned I know a bit about Photoshop. At quarter to five he got me to install it on my computer so I can begin graphics tasks tomorrow.

The last couple of days have been very rainy. I told Holly she should bring a Chinese umbrella since throwing one away there and buying a replacement here that costs ten times as much would be annoying. I think I'm also going to forgo trimming my beard till she can bring along ultracheap clippers. So far that's the main thing I forgot to bring from Canada that I kind of need. It's one thing to have a massive hobo beard when I'm off travelling but another when I'm going to work every day. 

I do love the small office vibe we've got where I don't have to feel underdressed in jeans and a half-buttoned shirt (over a tshirt - I don't expose my Hemsworthian pecs to the office just yet). It's possible I'm being ruined for corporate work, but that's all right with me.

Okay Mom, there you go, a pile of boring minutiae. This is what happens.
