Tomorrow I do my first storytime. It's an easy theme to do because it's all song-related. And it's easy to be goofy and make kids like you if you're all singing silly songs (with puppets). My favourite book we're going to do is a book telling the story of On Top of Spaghetti, with plenty of room for the kids to join in. Today I sat in on Targ's Time for Twos which is less my cup of tea, but whatever. Those kids don't get jokes yet. I volunteered to start doing the storytimes right away on purpose, so I can feel a bit more legitimate in not doing as much with the little bitty kids.

Tonight, after spending the afternoon finishing Anathem (very good but all in all I prefer the Baroque Cycle), I went to see Burn After Reading. It took a while to get into it, but by the end I really liked the movie. At first it felt a bit too Intolerable Cruelty, but got to something more in the good Coen Brothers stuff once Frances McDormand got screen time. There are clear parallels to The Big Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There, but it felt most like they were trying to remake Fargo (without the funny accents). So yeah, not as good as any of those three, but it had its heart in the right place.
