[ Overcompensating](http://wigu.com/overcompensating) is the best blog by a [cowboy poet](http://wigu.com/overcompensating/2005/01/imagine-pasta-bilities.html) in the world.
  

  
That is what the ladies want, though.  A nice settled down guy who gets on a shuttle every couple of weeks to make sure the space monkeys still have feces to throw.  Take it from me.
  

  
Sorry I haven't been blogging more.  Still sick, so still boring.  And I have Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to keep me company.  I haven't played a really involved game like this, umm, ever.  It really tries to be a movie.  Annoyingly so, like sometimes you have to wait half an hour for all the plot development to go by before you can go back to sneaking by a million more KGB guys (and then pulling out the AK-47 when all that sneaking doesn't work).
