The phase of the library reorganization affecting me is getting close to ending. All of the LSA3 canvass rankings have to be in by Friday at noon. Then they'll be slotting us into the jobs according to our seniority and how we ranked the positions. We're all tired of this whole process. Months ago a person dared to ask if they could make plans for Christmas. That person was told not to make any plans involving going anywhere because their package of hours would most likely be changed, and we'd be in our new jobs by early December. Now they're saying we'll be in our new jobs around the middle of February, just in time for the 2010 budget which will need us to lose more hours and we'll do this all again next year. Well, I say we'll do this again, but I'm not planning on being here. But still. 

Library employees are being jerked around a lot, and for some reason our union doesn't give a shit. Our union reps and management speak with one voice, telling us how much better this is than how they did it 20 years ago. I was told our only option is to elect someone else to city council because the union doesn't have any political capital outside of the clean water campaign or some such thing.

And then there's the madness of our department with Harriet and her lack of knowledge how anything in her department works. I skipped a step in a laborious task she gave me last week because it was unnecessary and would have added on an entire afternoon of work. When she found out she got me on the phone to tell me "when I ask you to do something I expect you to do it or things will be confusing" and I had to redo it. Robert helped and it turned out that my method had produced no catastrophe. I went to tell her that that work had not needed to be done and explained  why I did it the way I did and how I knew it wasn't a problem. The explanation passed right over her head because she doesn't know anything about how anything works in the library. And she refuses to learn. She takes pride in the fact that she doesn't have the qualifications that would allow her to do certain tasks. Of course, her job is safe.

It's funny how part of my reason for going to library school is spite. This whole system has so much crap in it, it's impossible to look at it and not see how things could be better. And none of us can do anything about it.

I like working in libraries but man, this one treats its staff like shit. I cannot wait to leave. And I'm lucky I'm so low in investment in the system and that I have somewhere to go. If I was a career (non-librarian) employee I have no idea what I would do. Hooray for still having choices in this world.

And man would it ever suck if no library school accepts me.
