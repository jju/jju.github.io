He doesn't write about superheroes.  His characters don't pose dramatically when it starts to rain.  They run inside.

He isn't a tortured artist living in an attic surrounded by work no one has ever seen.  His house is almost iconic: white, square and cute.  Cartoonish, you could say.

And that suits London, Ontario's most prolific independent comic artist just fine.

Daniel Barrick, 23, looks like he belongs in the comics he draws and writes.  His simple glasses, his slight frame, his short blond hair all could have been drawn with as few lines as possible.

Sitting in his parents' living room, the unimposing young man explains how important it is for artists to publish. "You develop your skills much better when they're out in the public," he says.  "Even if no one can find it, you still have this sense that someone's going to read it and someone's going to be waiting for it."

That's what separates him from lots of other aspiring artists.  He's selling his work.

Ace Armstrong: Diamonds is the latest comic book series he's working on, and his first with writer and creator Trevor Jamieson.  The first issue was launched in October at L.A. Mood Comics on Richmond Street.

It's a hard-boiled detective story in the film noir tradition, which Barrick says made it easy to draw. "As I read the script I could just see Bogart doing all the lines."

All of the work inside his comics is done by hand, without any computer assistance.  "I don't ever want my work to look too slick," he says.

Once the book is drawn he uses self-serve photocopiers to reproduce it and then gets it out to the stores.  Doing this is slower than releasing the comic in digital form on the Internet, but it's more satisfying for Barrick.  "It's something about the physicality of the book itself as an object, not as a string of ones and zeroes," he says.

Barrick graduated from Western in 2003 with an honours degree in fine arts.  The Mummydust Hourglass was his major project for his final year.  It's another comic book, which he's been selling in local shops since May.

His art training was very important and he quotes an artist - whose name he can't remember - about why.  "If you're going to be a cartoonist you need to learn how to draw.  Just learn how to draw, not how to draw cartoons."

Barrick stresses that making a cartoon's sparse lines eloquent isn't easy. "If you learn how to draw from cartoons then you're not really going to understand what youï¿½re doing."

Reading simple strips like Peanuts got him interested in the comic as an art form.  His dad had a collection of 1960s comic strips, including some obscure cowboy comics, when Barrick was a kid.  These influences meant he didn't take the stereotypical route through superhero comics.

You won't find anyone dressed in spandex in Ace Armstrong.  Getting the style for this book right required watching old movies like The Maltese Falcon.  That was no hardship for Barrick who loves movies, especially from before the days of colour.

Ace Armstrong is a collaboration with art-school friend Trevor Jamieson, who created the characters, wrote the script and delivered it to Barrick to draw.

This is Barrick's first time drawing for a comic he didn't write.  "It's very freeing to be able to just concentrate on the drawing and the shapes of things as you lay them out," he says.

His studio is his tiny bedroom in the house he's lived in with his parents and younger brother since he was two years old.  His drawing table takes up a quarter of the room.  Drawings from the second issue of Ace Armstrong are propped up against the wall.  A sketchbook laying out how things will progress in the series lies on his bed's Star Wars blanket.

All around his room are books that have influenced him.  Barrick says he appreciates artists with a simple visual style like Jeff Smith, who writes and draws the award-winning comic, Bone.

Barrick has been drawing since grade three when he would draw and write about a monster named Uli.  When he was ten years old his parents enrolled him in drawing and cartooning classes.

But he stresses that comics aren't a kids' medium.  "It's strange that people don't see it the same way that they see other media," he says.

For example, Finding Nemo and Citizen Kane are both movies.  No one would say that means Citizen Kane is just for kids.  Barrick says that kind of thing happens all the time when people discuss comics instead of movies.

Often comic artists aren't taken seriously because of that kiddie label.  But simple doesn't equal silly, Barrick says.  He only had to defend that position a few times in his fine arts program.  He's happy with how supportive his teachers and colleagues at Western were.

Since graduating with his BFA in 2003, he's been working at Staples Business Depot in the copyshop.  The books he's selling in London comic shops are only making enough money to break even now.  But he wants to pursue comics as a career, and will be going back to school for his master's degree next year.

Until then he says the most important thing is to get his work out where people can see it. "That's what will make my work even better."

The first issue of Ace Armstrong: Diamonds is available at L.A. Mood Comics, Heroes, and The Comic Book Collector in London, Ontario.  The second issue should be released by February.
