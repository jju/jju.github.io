Something Positive, one of my favourite webcomics, recently did a [storyline](http://somethingpositive.net/sp03132005.shtml) on separating writers from their political opinions.  
  
Another webcomic I haven't followed from the beginning but am now getting into in the reruns is Queen of Wands, whose author talked about the real life version of the Something Positive storyline in her [commentary on the strip](http://www.queenofwands.net/d/20050402.html).  Now she's posted a bit more about it on her blog [Aeire.com](http://aeire.com/postings/1112515182.shtml): 

<blockquote>"Perhaps it's just me then, that looks up to writers as heroes and role-models. Maybe it's just that I spent entirely too much time reading books when I was a child, and learning from them instead of learning from those around me. But I tend to build up these authors as paragons of what they write, when it's something that I've integrated so personally into my life. And it's hard, very hard, once that curtain is open to ignore the little man behind it pulling levers and pressing buttons. "</blockquote>

It's not just her.  
  
I don't mind Orson Scott Card but I don't care that much.  The reason I mention any of this is because I too take authors too seriously.  They should be perfect, nigh godlike beings because they create.  And I know they're just people who tell stories.  
  
But.  That image of how writers should be perfect persists.  And (if you don't care about my neuroses you might as well bail out now, or read [Websnark's take](http://www.websnark.com/archives/2005/04/heinlein_card_a.html) on this issue) I get to use it as an excuse not to write, myself.  I know how I have to pull levers and press buttons and that doesn't fit the image of writer that I've always had.  So I can justify not writing by saying I can't live up to the impossible standards that I've created, so why bother?  Even though I know the standards are bullshit.  
  
So there you go.
