Thursday was my second-last shift as a page and the library was closed due to a water main break or something. So my book-stacking time was very peaceful. Friday will be my last page shift (and I think the library will be open) then I start the new job on Tuesday.

I've been getting a few people saying congratulations when they've heard I bought a condo (the final lawyer signing stuff hasn't happened yet, but the bank signed off so it's all good to go) which strikes me as odd. Why is buying something a congratulatory event? If I was moving to a new apartment I was renting would people congratulate me? It's not like it's "Congratulations for moving out on your own into the big scary world" or anything. Specifically congratulations on having bought property. At least that's how it sounds to me. And it sounds odd.

People have also said "You must be excited" a bunch. And yeah I am, but more because I like moving than because of the purchased property aspect. Last night Sean said something about me buying a place seeming weird when I've spoken disparagingly of 12 month leases. Which is true. Thinking about it in those terms makes me want to vomit a little bit. When people say "[How very grown up of you](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2008/07/25/on-changes/#comment-1232)" I just want to cry. That's when it feels like this big symbol of me being tied to this city and not going out and doing interesting things with my life.

But. I bought this place because it saves me money on rent for the time being. That it makes the money I had sitting around useful by providing me with shelter so I don't have to work more than one job, that I can keep on plugging away at the writing, futile as it seems. I'm not chained to this place until I die; things that are bought can be sold again. Or I can rent it out myself when I fuck off to some other country and make a bit of money as an absentee landlord. And for now my cat doesn't have to go live with strangers (or worse).  I have to remember all these things or I feel awful and ashamed of the whole dirty business.

I cannot wait to start the new job so I can think about something else.
