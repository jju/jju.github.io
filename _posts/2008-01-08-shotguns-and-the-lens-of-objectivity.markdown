I read [No Country for Old Men](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0375706674%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0375706674%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) today and enjoyed it. Thanks Steve. I still haven't seen the movie but I'm definitely glad I read it first. Since all I've seen of the trailer is people shooting each other I don't have any actor faces stuck in the roles of these different characters. I only know Tommy Lee Jones is in the movie but not which person he's playing (though I can guess). The book doesn't have the same kind of WTF?! ending that I understand the movie has, which is also good.

I've also been spending time these past few days playing with my new camera. On the left there you can see some of the Necromunda shots I put up on Flickr, but man, playing with a flash adds so much to what you can do. I've been taking buckets of photos of the same thing (like say a discarded paisley gourd) with the light pointed in different directions and cranking up and down shutter speeds. I'm starting to get the hang of how to manipulate some of those tools, and it's a lot of fun. The pictures aren't fantastic yet, but I'm working on it.
