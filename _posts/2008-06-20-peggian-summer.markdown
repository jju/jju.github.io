I got a bit sunburnt at the Goldeyes game yesterday but nothing too bad thanks to the expired sunblock Sean picked up and left behind. The fish lost by a bunch but the game was filled with home runs and errors, and some nice work in left field.

Our page quotient at the library has skyrocketed. The downside is that means there are fewer unfilled shifts so I don't get to be choosy about the hours I pick up to keep me in rent and food. And that means I had to take a shift for the Thursday night of Folk Fest. So I won't be coming out till Friday after work, and will be missing the Weakerthans on mainstage. Le sigh.
