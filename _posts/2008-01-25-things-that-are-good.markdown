I'm so full. I'd almost forgotten what it's like to have dinner at Mom's. And to have leftovers to eat tomorrow and the day after and the day after that. Awesome.

My remote trigger for my camera arrived today. Not for the camera itself but the thing that lets me fire the flash wirelessly. It's pretty sweet. Now I can start doing real [Strobist](http://strobist.com)ish kinds of things. The transmitter is the cheapy Cactus one, not a umpty hundred dollar Pocket Wizard, so it doesn't fire every single time I try. But when it works it works greatly. Though all I've done so far is take Steve the Cat pictures. What can I say? He's the model that's most accessible.

Also, I finished (the horrible first draft of) Part One of the story I've been working on. I don't know how many parts there will be, but this was definitely it for Part One. At some point I'll type up what I have and do massive revisions, but the idea now is to plunge on through the meat curtain into Part Two.
