It's different listening to an election result on the radio.  I've got my CBC going and am sort of listening.  Radio doesn't do numbers really well.  We learned this first term at J School.  So it's all talking about different issues.  I've heard people talking about how religion works in presidential campaigns, and now about how all the legal challenges and things like that work.  I find on TV I don't listen to this stuff, because I'm distracted by all the shiny graphics floating around.  Not so much information overload as sometimes.  
  
The AP map just popped up the W win in Texas (145-112 EV for W), so it's caught up with the radio.  I think that's pretty funny.  But it makes sense, the coders take more time to get their info on there and the radio guys just need to speak.  
  
They just called CBC the "prediction free network."  All analysis all the time.  
  
Oops.  Now the states above Texas have all turned red.
