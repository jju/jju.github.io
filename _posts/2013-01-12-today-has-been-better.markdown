I always feel like I should do a followup post after a very negative one. Especially since my mom'll be back from India soon and will read this again. She'll think the world has ended if I leave something unhappy lying around for too long.

Today I got my car towed to the dealership in Courtenay. They'll look after it and call me about whatever needs doing to get the car running again. It's out of my hands now till the bill has to be paid. And I have to get down to Courtenay to get my car back. Whatever.

It's sunny and I bought Neil Gaiman's new picturebook about a sneezing panda.
