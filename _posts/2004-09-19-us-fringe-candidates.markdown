[Robocratic.com :: The Official Website of the American Robocratic Party](http://www.robocratic.com/economy.shtml):

"We asked 1,024 registered voters to choose if they wanted our country to be more 'Awesome' or 'Full of Losers.' Americans overwhelmingly chose 'Awesome.' The past is dirty and full of oppression and disease. The future is clean, bright, shiny and full of robots. The future is Awesome. Americans want to be Awesome. The evidence is incontrovertible. "

Follow the link for a graphic that shows that incontrovertible evidence in a sassy little pie chart.

If I was an American I'd have a tough time choosing between the Robocratic party and [Republicans for Voldemort](http://www.goats.com/archive/030808.html): "Why choose the lesser of two evils?"
