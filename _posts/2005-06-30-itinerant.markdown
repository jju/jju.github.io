So this is the official Travel Plans post.  If you hear of uprisings and riots along these routes you are not supposed to worry.  You are supposed to realize that uprisings mean Justin's having a great time.
  

  
Tomorrow I'll head up to Nanchong where [Holly](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hollyrinny) is giving her last exam.  If all goes well, we leave on Saturday for Lanzhou, which is kind of the transport hub for heading up to Urumqi (which is spelled and pronounced quite differently in Chinese, but I'm stubbornly using my version of the Uyghur way).
  

  
Urumqi has gobs of stuff around there so we'll be there for a while.  By the next Sunday (July 10) we should be in Kashgar for the Sunday market, inshallah.  Then we start making our way east again.  Probably go to Dunhuang and Turpan.
  

  
Somehow we will get to Jilin where our friend Theresa Rempel lives around the 18th or 19th.  We'll spend a few days there, hopefully involving a trip to the DPRK border and then go to Beijing for the 23rd.
  

  
Then it's Beijing until August 17th.  Which seems like a really long time, but maybe I'll get some real Chinese learning done.  Stranger things have happened.
  

  
My bag is packed and my vacation reading is The Count of Monte Cristo, which will hopefully last through to Beijing.  I read an abridged version years ago, but that hardly counts.  Abridged versions are an even worse evil than fullscreen movies which are dubbed.
  

  
To make up for my shot recorder I'm bringing along my film camera.  Man that thing's huge.  But I'm going to a place where things'll be pretty.  And man is that place ever not Beijing.
  

  
I'll be checking email and updating the blog sporadically.  Possibly even tomorrow.  But every day-ness will have to wait till at least Beijing (where I hope my roommate will have a computer to get on the net that I can use) and possibly till I get back.
  

  
Till then I'll be a pen & paper blogger.  There must be a word for that.  Someone who writes in a journal.  Hmm. I think a phrase needs to be coined.
  

  
Have a good summer (and I expect Folk Fest reports from people damnit).  I've got a "So long!" picture up on Flickr if you want to see my hobo beard before it gets put to the test.
