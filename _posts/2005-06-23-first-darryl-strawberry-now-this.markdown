In other weird news vaguely connected to my hometown, two baseball teams in the Northern League are playing the first two innings of their July 16th game on the Xbox: [Old ballgame has newfangled twist](http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/11944265.htm).
  

  
The Northern League is, of course, where the Winnipeg Goldeyes play.  It's pretty minor in the minor leagues, but it seems they've been expanding while I've been out of town.
