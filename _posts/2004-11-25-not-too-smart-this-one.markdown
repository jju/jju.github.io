I'm having flashbacks to fakeLondon where I spent huge chunks of last winter huddled around Joy's tiny space heater, letting no heat get through me to her frigid basement suite.

I've been avoiding using my space heater here just because I don't want to get too dependent on it.  But I turned it on today and am suffering the consequences that any addict knows all too well.  I left it in the living room to type this up and I'm already going through a shivering withdrawal.  I'd take up smoking to get more heat in me, but I heard that nicotine actually lowers your body temperature or something.  I'd do research but I have to get back to my glowing orange smack.

And I want to go to Tibet in the winter.
