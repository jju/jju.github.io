I've just eaten a lunch of wonderful Canadian delicacies.  Old cheddar cheese and stoned wheat thins.  A friend of my mom's is in China and came to Wanzhou.  She brought me gifts and food.  It was all good.
  

  
Of course, I'm strictly rationing the cheese.  I've already started to worry about what will happen when it's all gone.
