There're only three weeks left in this term.  You would think I'd be getting excited about leaving teaching behind me for a couple of months, but I'm not.  
  
I really think the problem is this program in Beijing we've got to go to for July 23.  It means Holly and I can't be lazy in our northern China wandering.  I'm a big fan of lazy travelling, so having a three week time limit is freakishly stifling.  Especially for the distance we're looking at covering.  It makes my head hurt to think about it in much the same way it does when I think about the logistics of my mom coming to visit.  
  
I just don't want it all to suck.  And with such a short time there's a real chance that suckiness could overwhelm things.  And it won't just be sucky for me, but for my travelling buddy and it'll all be my fault for wanting to get to too many places than is feasible or for settling for too little because it's so much easier.  
  
(Don't worry [guys] about this.  I'll be in my cheerfully pessimistic travelling mood by the time we actually leave.  This is just standard pre-trip angst bubbling out because there's no one here to stifle it for.)
