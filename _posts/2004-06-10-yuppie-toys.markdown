I know a certain person who gets mad at all those pretentious yuppies who go to [MEC](http://www.mec.ca) just to look outdoorsy, when the closest they get is a [latte](http://www.starbucks.com) in their [Element](http://www.honda.ca/HondaEng/Models/Element/Overview.htm) in the suburbs.  I am doomed to forever disappoint her because yesterday I got myself another great MEC hoodie and topped the day off with purchasing the ultimate symbol of people with too much money: an [iPod](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/72208/wo/pD7oPebatcbj23SlVDKFsyLGNTq/0.0.7.1.0.5.21.1.4.1.0.0.0.1.0).
  

  
To be fair, the iPod (which is ridiculously cute fast and amazing) was bought with prize money.  You see, I won the Norman Jewison Prize for Creative Writing for my radio documentary [Guerrilla Words](http://www.fims.uwo.ca/radio/newraw/documentaries/documentaries.htm#justin) (primarily).  The prize was $1,000 and so here I am with a new toy.  I also justify it by pointing out that I'm going to fucking China, where toys will be hard to come by.
  

  
Stevie G's band [Alverstone](http://www.geocities.com/alverstonetheband) is opening for [Quinzy](http://www.highnorthrecords.com/bands/quinzy/index2.htm) on Thursday at Eddie's Garage (or whatever it's called now).  Good times shall ensue.
