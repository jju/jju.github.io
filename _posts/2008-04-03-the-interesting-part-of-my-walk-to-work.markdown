Portage and Colony is just the kind of intersection where you expect a guy to careen around the sidewalk on his bicycle in the the snow. So it's unsurprising when ... up over the curb and into it and almost down and swerve and almost but not quite and then oh no ... there he is, wiped out.

I'm the only one there so I stop sort of half-turned and ask if he's all right. He slurs back at me "Don'tworryI'musedtoit," while he blows on his bloodied up palms. Walking on, I keep my eyes open for the kind of dog that bites.
