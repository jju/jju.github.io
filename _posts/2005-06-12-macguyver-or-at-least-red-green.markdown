This lack of a phone (for that slight possibility of communication) finally pissed me off enough to do something about it besides waiting for Monday to ask Miss Wang to get somebody to come fix it.  I hear phones ringing in all sorts of apartments around mine, so it's not like the whole building's were out, just mine.
  

  
This afternoon I pulled up the carpet to follow the phone line through my apartment and find where the problem was.  It seemed to be at the point where a bunch of wires were haphazardly taped together.  Through careful testing I found which ones needed to be actually touching instead of just hanging out in each other's proximity for my phone to function and taped those suckers together.  Success.
  

  
Now I return to choosing to ignore it when the phone rings.
