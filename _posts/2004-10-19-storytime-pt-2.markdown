Here's where this whole reverse chronological part of blogging gets silly, but I just didn't want to put it all into one huge post.  Read part one of this story [here](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/2004/10/storytime.html), or just further down on the page.  Or don't.  I'm not the boss of you.

So has the cliffhanger put you on the edge of your seat?  The ominously blurry picture?  The (probably horribly wrong) pinyin translation?  The fact that I obviously survived to tell my tale?

Alright.  I get off the bus wondering where I'll find the thing that's interesting enough to keep all the students locked up on campus and I figure following the riot squad might do it.  They weren't actually doing anything though.  Just standing around.  Traffic was going by and there were lots of cops.

Now I know as well as the next ignorant foreigner that you don't take pictures of military installations and things.  So I knew I had to be sneaky.  That's why the pictures you'll see on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j) are blurry and/or have people obstructing them.  But after a few shots I thought, well, maybe they won't really mind if I get close and get a quick good picture.  I mean they aren't actively kicking the shit out of anyone; there can't be anything wrong with that.

There can.  I edged closer and just stood for a while right next to the riot squad.  They got an order that they could sit down.  "Sweet," I thought.  I was in a perfect position to get a shot of the front line sitting on their shields with their helmets right next to them.  These cops were young and skinny, so vulnerable next to their armour.  It would have been awesome.  I turned my camera on in my bag and pulled it out.  One second later a small officer kind of guy (he was wearing a hat, not a helmet) was in my face screaming at me.

Camera off and in my pocket, hands in the air, "Duibuqi, duibuqi!"  Screaming screaming screaming.  Soldiers standing up uncertainly.  Crowd bubbled around me.

I realize this is a bit different than dealing with the Foreign Affairs Office at the college.

A woman who could speak English told me what I knew already, that I wasn't allowed to take pictures.  "Oh, it wasn't because I didn't take off my hat? Thanks."  I said I wouldn't take any.  She said they trust me but I should go home.  I said fine and walked off, super thankful that they didn't demand to see my camera and the crappy pictures I had already taken.

I walk down the street, turn left and head for the [main square](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/776426/).  The entire thing is surrounded by riot soldiers.  No one is allowed inside, but around the edges are crowds upon crowds.  Sadly, I learned my lesson and have no pictures from this time.

I'm standing and watching the police wandering in the square when a guy in a black suit with a camera bag came to the rail that I was watching from.  He was inside the square, on the side of the police.  There had been a fairly dense press of people around me until then, but for the second time in twenty minutes there was a bubble of space between me and a crowd that was staring at me.  I'm doing the oblivious thing, ignoring black suit man, but I notice a few more guys with shields (and batons and rifles) moving to an open edge like they're going to leave the perimeter and come my way.  Even though I'm sure I'm just paranoid, I decide to find a new spot to watch from.

I spent a couple of hours watching the police and the crowds around this square, having no idea what was going on.  I still don't know.  But there were clusters of people doing the Chinese bicycle accident thing, getting into discussions with like fifty people and cyclical arguers.  There was also a bank that looked like it had had a fire, but there were no cops around it.  It didn't make any sense.

I have notes and once I have some idea of what was actually happening, there'll be an article in the journalism section.

No phone call from Miss Wang about me leaving campus yet.
