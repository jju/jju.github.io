I've hung out with some of my fellow teachers a bit and it seems like we'll have a good time in Beijing next month.  And I'm unpacking a bunch of things that will be useless from my bags when I get back to Winnipeg.
  

  
I saw [Fahrenheit 911](http://www.fahrenheit911.com/) on Friday with some people.  It did what I thought it would do.  I thought the recruiting stuff was the best done, the Coalition of the Willing segment the worst (because of all the racism inherent in it), and the Michael Moore stunts bearable (ie not cringe-inducing).  The thing I didn't expect was my van full of people talking about how they weren't able to sleep, and how traumatic watching the movie was.  Okay, maybe I'm part of the MTV generation and maybe I'm already well on my way to becoming a cynical jaded journalist, but there wasn't anything in there that didn't make sense with how I know the world works.  There wasn't anything that grotesque or awful.  So, in conclusion, I saw the movie with a bunch of wimps.
  

  
A better movie than Fahrenheit 911 is **Battleground: 21 days in Iraq** by [Guerrilla News Network's](http://www.guerrillanews.com) Stephen Marshall.  It talks directly about the war and how it's affecting people. The crew follows an Iraqi man being reunited with his family after 12 years in the U.S.  and there is just so much good stuff in there I can't believe it.  It deals with depleted uranium, the fictitious resistance movement, the ways American soldiers respond to local government and the quest of capitalism in the world.  Really really good.
  

  
This orientation is just dragging on and on.
