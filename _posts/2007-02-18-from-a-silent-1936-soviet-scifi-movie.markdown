"We are rapidly approaching the moon!  To the baths!"  
  
There's a bit of interpretation there.  The translation of the title card only said "To the baths!"  But I wanted you know what was going on.    
  
You see, Russian people really like to bathe.  Especially when the virile man in the prime of his life has been left behind on dull old Earth so the old man, the woman and the kid could emasculate him completely by having a gay old time in weightlessness.  
  
This was fantastika.  What is fantastika?  [Warren Ellis](http://warenellis.com) says:

<blockquote>Fantastika appears to be the Russian word for speculative, slipstream or science fiction.  Isn't that a gorgeous word?  Fantastika.  Much better than fantastique.  Fantastique is arch.  Fantastika is spiky.  
  
"What do you write?"  
"I write FANTASTIKA.  And I just shagged your wife until she saw God.  Get away from me now, shitbreath."</blockquote>

Fantastika!
