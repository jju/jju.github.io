I just finished watching Psycho on IFC.  Not the original Psycho, but the 1998 shot for shot remake with Vince Vaughn.  When it was released I remember dismissing it as a stupid idea.  Now though, well, it was an interesting experiment.  It is very different watching actors I feel I know in those roles.  I'm not saying it's better than the original, but there is a point to be made in doing something like that.  It would have been a very different technical exercise.  All the decisions had been made; this team was working within those limitations.  Of course, those limitations are from one of the best, so there's still a lot of room to fuck it up.  
  
Now what I want to see is a version that mashes the two versions together.  Like up till the shower scene in the original, then flipping over to the new one for investigation.  Or using the audio from one on the other's visuals.  I think that'd work better if you put the new dialogue on the old pictures.  That must exist out there already though, right?
