I love [Boingboing](http://boingboing.net) for pointing out great articles like this one. [Quitting the Paint Factory](http://web.ionsys.com/~remedy/Quitting The Paint Factory.htm): 

<blockquote>"I distrust the perpetually busy; always have. The frenetic ones spinning in tight little circles like poisoned rats. The slower ones, grinding away their fourscore and ten in righteousness and pain. They are the soul-eaters."</blockquote>

 Also good on this subject is Milan Kundera's book Slowness.
