Tianchi lake looks immensely like Banff.  Right down to the crowds of Asian tourists.  Luckily they tend to stick to the parking lot and on boats with their tour groups leaving the wild parts to the Kazakh residents and the Westerners.  
  
Holly and I hiked around a bunch at this lake (it's a couple of hours outside Urumqi).  There was a waterfall and a lake and a temple, all very nice.  Holly was pretending to be a Canadian for a day by using my little backpack with the flag on it.  Pretty ironic for the fourth of July, eh?  
  
When it got excellent though was after about 5pm when all the buses took the day-trippers away and we could stay in a Kazakh yurt.  
  
A yurt is like a big Mongolian tent thingy with a raised floor and blankets for walls.  We stayed at the recommended in the Lonely Planet yurt owned by a guy named Rachit (who we never saw - Reyn will remember the Kumiko pension in Bodrum as a parallel; the rest of you probably won't).  There were 8 other foreigners there, including a bunch of Americans, a Norwegian and a German.  It was a great time.  We played 99, and saw the stars (eventually), and discussed politics and religion, and climbed up the side of the mountain and eventually ate lunch with them.  Great time.  Best fourth of July ever, I might say.  
  
Now we're back in Urumqi and will take the train out to Kashgar tomorrow.  It'll be a long ride but worth it I hope.  
  
It seems like there'd be more but this time I just wanted to let you know what was happening and that we're having a good time.  And tonight Holly took a picture of me eatin' a pigeon with chopsticks.  Betcha they don't do that in Africa!
