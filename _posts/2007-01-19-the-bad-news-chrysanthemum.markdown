I just returned from seeing [Curse of the Golden Flower](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473444/) the latest Zhang Yimou flick.  Now, I'm sure my peeps back in the real red state have seen it six times just on the buses already, but bear with me.  I liked it.  Part of it was just the (movie)Chinaness of it.  The big mountain behind the Forbidden City, the dramatic countryside a horseride away, that kind of thing.  I also liked picking bits of the subtitles apart.  The few bits I could gather.  It was difficult to refrain from nudging Sean and telling him what verb/adjective had just been translated as "Yes" all the time.  
  
One of the things about ZYM's movies is that if you want to, it's really easy to see them as political allegories.  I remember people in the States being pissed off because [Hero](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/) was all about the greatness of the One China policy as it relates to Taiwan.  Which missed the point, as I see it.  
  
I realize that lots of things are political.  I feel like I know how to look for that kind of stuff, whether to make me feel smart or to analyze the message I'm paying to get shoved into my brain before I fully accept it.  That's especially the case in things that are made under a set of rules I don't agree with.  
  
But politics are politics and not everything has to be about messages.  If Golden Flower had a message it was one that was pretty classically Chinese; ZYM works within the state censorship system after all.  I felt myself looking for the message in the final bit of the movie.  If one person dies, the movie was trying to tell me this Chinese value, if this person dies, they're trying to make me accept this other one.  It bugged me that I was doing that, that I was looking for messages when I was supposed to be lost in the story.  (Of course, the weird arhythmic nature of the film precluded that happening naturally.)
