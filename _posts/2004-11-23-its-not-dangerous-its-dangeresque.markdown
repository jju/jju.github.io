My friend Terri just sent me a great article by Dan Gillmor: [China Bloggers Emerge, But Not Too Loudly](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/011043.shtml#011043).  That idea of danger-chill is something that I completely understand, especially for journalists who have to live here.  A Chinese blog would pretty much have to be even more personal than political.  I mean, if I post pictures of the military suppressing a riot I get kicked out of the country (No I don't - Shhh).  They have to live here for the rest of their lives.  
  
I'm just saying I should take advantage of my status here and blog some more things that Chinese bloggers might like to say but can't.  Don't worry mom, I'm not going to start talking about [CENSORED] or [CENSORED] and get deported or put in jail.
