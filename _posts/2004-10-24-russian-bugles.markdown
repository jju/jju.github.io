One of the things that I've started eating far more of here than at home are Bugles.  You know the little corn duncecap shaped chip substitutes.  Well at the grocery store nearby they have them.  I have no idea what flavour any of them are, except for one, which was labeled korean pork.  
  
Each flavour has its own little cartoon emblem though and as you can see here, this one is a Russian penguin with Tetris blocks.  As far as I can tell, they aren't penguin flavoured.  
  
You might also see peanut butter Oreos in the background.  Meh.  
  
And the China Daily headline is pretty standard around here.  We get something like that at least twice a week (Chen is the leader in Taiwan).
