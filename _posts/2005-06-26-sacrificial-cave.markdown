I'm not entirely sure why everyone here thinks I'm some sort of invalid, but all my students come over for very short amounts of time because "you need your rest."
  

  
I don't yawn excessively.  I've never fallen asleep in front of any visitors.  I'm not smelly, and though my apartment may be a mess of papers it doesn't stink.
  

  
I wish people actually felt comfortable here instead of it always turning into a little English corner or a quick expedition by a pair of students.  But one that I can say get out when I'm sick of speaking in ESL.
