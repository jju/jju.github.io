Maybe you noticed, maybe you didn't but you're being redirected to a blogspot page right now.  Blogger and my webhost aren't getting along again, so instead of getting them to fix it I've taken a least resistance style path.  I'm tempted to take this time to migrate fully off of my host.  There are lots of free services out there and really, what's important (ha!) here is the content, not the look of the site, right?  The main issue I'd have with leaving my host is that I haven't received a bill from them in forever, and I don't want to draw attention to myself if I owe them money.  We'll see how it goes.
