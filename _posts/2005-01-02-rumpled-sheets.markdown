Sometimes I wonder why I'm not some sort of statistician.  I spent the morning (after being completely woken up by my mom phoning - I'd expected the call at 9 and would have been awake by then, but it was 7:20 and I couldn't think or speak at all) building tables to compare how my two classes did in British Culture.  
  
Then I realize that being a statistician would turn me into an even more boring person than I already am.  This way it's an occasional dalliance with spreadsheets and the illicitness makes it all the more fun.  
  
And I don't have to call the next day.
