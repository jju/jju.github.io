"I'm just waiting for someone to pull a gun and end this summer already."It's the fourth round of the fight and I'm second-guessing myself.  Not on the poorness of the choice to be out with the guys - that'd come with the softballs - but on my pick for who'd win the foxy boxing.  From the start my money had been on Innocence.  Not because her name reminded me of seven-year-old girls knocking each other's teeth out, but because of her pacing scowl.  She'd clobbered her way to the final round and the shot at $100, which was more than the two bits and tanning minutes I'd been led to believe was the prize.  Once there, this girl called Bruiser let Innocence have it.  They were trading body shots and good solid punches to the head, but it was too close for Innocence, who lost unanimously.

We say fuck it; we're Leaders of Tomorrow and we've seen American titties tonight and endured the fatass radio lecher's commentary for long enough.  We leave the bar and find softballs in the truck.  The first one gets thrown while we drive.  Then more are dug out of the back and are thrown at signs and cyclists.  We're being paced down Pembina by a Civic Del Sol, a convertible, and it seems like a really good idea to throw a softball into the car.  Poor choice, but a good idea.  It tries to cut us off.  Then we're sitting at a stop signal next to it and our driver gives them a lecture. "In life there are good choices and there are poor choices. You just made a poor choice," he says while holding our penultimate softball where they can see it.  We take off, wait for them catch up again chase them and then turn off Pembina as they drive by.  Just before we turn, the drunkest of tomorrow's leaders lets that lecture prop fly at the Del Sol.  It hits the car's spoiler and bounces around the back while their shotgunner gets up and screams at us.  They don't chase us, but we take precautions anyway.  They don't shoot us either, which is disappointing if you're waiting for the Summer of Poor Choices to just finish itself off for fuck's sake.
