Listening to the new Weezer disc tonight, I was pulling parallllelllls (fuck it, I always spell it wrong so it's going to be flagrantly wrong) to my last blog entry.  Not as a whole, just the Hell's Angels thing.  As Sean commented, he was ticked off about how we moved from them to Super Soakers.  Now where did my Weezer connection come in?  Hmm . . . maybe it'll come back to me.  Anyway, I was thinking about how I flip flop on the stupidity of my existence (existence?  is that what you're talking about?  man, you should have put a pretentiousness alert at the beginning of this)[Quiet You!].  Sometimes I look at how I get caught up in cool stuff, just talking about old cartoons and action figures and stuff, studiously avoiding anything that actual responsible people might talk about and it pisses me off; I mean, I'm not in high school anymore, shouldn't I start to take an interest in the world around me as a serious participant in it?  Aren't I supposed to be some sort of a grown-up yet?  Most of the time, though, I'd rather revel in my triviality, how nothing will be changed by vague reminiscences about half remembered television.  My family (extended, so you don't think I'm talking about my mom) thinks I have no opinions on anything, because I tend to say nothing when they get into "serious" discussions.  It bugs my mother to no end to see me sit there quietly without proferring my opinion through all sorts of arguments until someone mentions a movie or a book, which I'll talk about.  But that falls into the trivial kind of thing.  The world isn't a better or worse place because of how Detective Dormer and his room look when the light is turned on in Insomnia.  No that's not true, my world is a better place because of that light being turned on.  Maybe that's the thing.  Things that affect the world out there don't affect the world behind my eyes.  Or that the world behind my eyes is the only one that I feel strongly enough about to comment on, and that world doesn't have anything to do with all that other stuff.  Well, it does, but only in some abstract sense that I can't get behind, so I spend my days fishing in triviality.  And that was the Weezer connection: Keep Fishin' sparked this thought process, which didn't really go anywhere.  Selah.
