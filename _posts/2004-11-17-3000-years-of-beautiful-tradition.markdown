The Xinjian restaurant down the street from the college is finally selling nan-bread (or whatever it's called in Chinese - Gan? Whatever.  I use the Indian term happily).  Xinjian is where most of China's Muslims live and their food is (surprise!) different from the rest of China's.  Most importantly they make bread.  You don't realize how wonderful it is to eat bread that is not sweet or steamed.  I like steamed baozi that are all filled with tastiness, but it's not bread, you know?  This is bread that is wonderful.  Unleavened, yes, but Moses, Mohammed and Sandy Koufax can't all be wrong.
