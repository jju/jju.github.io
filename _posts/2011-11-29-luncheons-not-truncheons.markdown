It is my final week at work and it seems we'll be having many a lunch. Last Thursday Holly and Edmund and Rob and I went for Thai food around the corner (since Holly was on her way to New Zealand the next day). That was pleasant enough. The food at the Thai place is a lot sweeter and not nearly so spicy as better Thai food, but still. We never did get to go out bushwalking, what with Holly's schedule at Patisse occupying her so much of her weekend time here.

Then Holly went to Christchurch on Friday. I spent my weekend doing homework, watching movies, eating the last of the food in our cupboards (I didn't want to buy any groceries this week, but ended up getting some ice cream today), and thinking about buying a pair of shoes. 

I also sold Holly's bike and the rental agent came by to show the apartment to a prospective renter. He's such a slippery guy. He came in pointing and concern-trolling about how the place looked. There was a bit of mold on one of the walls that is nothing resembling our fault, but he tsk tsked and said when we do the final inspection on Friday he hopes it'll be cleaned up. He could of course quote a price on getting it cleaned professionally... Fucking guy. Peter is going to move into our rooms and wants our double mattress, the one we found on the street. He's also going to look after some of our stuff between me leaving on the 2nd and us heading back to the North on the 19th. Hooray for Peter.

Yesterday Edmund and Rob and I went up the Sydney Tower for lunch in the revolving restaurant. It was excellent. The place was filled with old people, and the elevators seemed in poor condition, but we watched the city rotate slowly beneath us for an hour. We could see all the way out to the Blue Mountains and Manly and the airport as well as peer down and marvel at the cranes and window washing apparatus so many tall buildings have as part of their superstructure. The vegetarian options were probably the best I've had at a buffet like that. Baba Ganoush and bread, loads of good salads, Indianish and Chinese dishes, all in all pretty decent.

Friday will be my last day at work. I've got the apartment inspection in the morning and have to get on a plane at around 6:30pm. And then I'll be joining Holly in a life of vagabondery for a while. I never feel as much like myself as when I'm on a train or a bus or other conveyance. It's going to be a good December.
