It was a crappy day, but it's done.  Tomorrow I just have to bring the marks down to the office and fill out a few more forms.  And then go find a ticket to Tibet.  I really hope that isn't as difficult as it could be.  Supposedly I'll be able to get a ticket here in Wanzhou.  I hope that's true.

But no one has been available to help me go buy some ticket.  Going and blundering through will be gobs of fun I'm sure.
