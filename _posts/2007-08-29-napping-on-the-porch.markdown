Just sent in a new edit on that story.  And it does keep getting better.  Even though I liked the second version better than the first I completely see how this third version is better than those.  
  
Next week I'm looking after my mom's dogs for ten days.  That seems like a long time.  
  
I forgot my keys when I went to work today, so I had to wait till Alison got back to let me into the house after work.  I really have to stop switching jackets just before I leave the house.
