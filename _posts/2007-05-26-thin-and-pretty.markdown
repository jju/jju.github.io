I've been looking at computers online a bit.  Mine's getting old and everyone cool's getting new MacBooks.  If I had the money today I'd probably be getting a MacBook, but there's a part of me that wants something smaller for travelling.  I mean, more and more my computer is primarily a word processor/internet connector.  So huge specs aren't that important, but battery life and weight are.  But I'd really like to wait until I could get a solid state hard drive.  Fewer moving parts, you know.  
  
This got sparked when I saw a girl with a tiny little Vaio laptop down at the library.  What a sexy little machine.  Almost as sexy as someone I know.  
(Not you, Sean.)
