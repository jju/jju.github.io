We have a new branch head! Art is going to be starting at Intrepid sometime in January. I worked with Art once. He's only a year or two older than me and seems very nice. I don't know if this means I'll be able to leave anytime sooner though. Evidently they're having problems filling my position. But I'm scheduled for 311 training as a Section 22 person on January 14, so ideally I'll actually be there by then.

Have I talked about 311 here before? The library isn't going to have phone numbers for individual branches anymore in the new year. If you want to do anything you'll dial 311 and they'll give you library hours and sign you up for programs and if you have questions they'll pass them on to the libraries to find out the answers and call you back. Which seems pretty inefficient and impersonal but whatever.

Targ actually told me yesterday that she's getting me to do her work for the Baby Rhyme Times forever so she never has to think about it again. Which is... honest? She was also telling me how she needed that detective story list despite summer reading being half a year away because "these things just sneak up on you and don't just happen overnight." And I refrained from pointing out that she'll just get whoever my replacement is to do all the work for it anyway so what does that have to do with her?
