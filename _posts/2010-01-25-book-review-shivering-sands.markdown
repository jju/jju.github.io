[Warren Ellis](http://warrenellis.com) writes a lot on the internet. [Shivering Sands](http://www.librarything.com/work/9187769/book/55113427) is a collection of his essays. They're very good even though I'd read them all before. He talks about writing about cooking about music and most importantly about the future. This book was a Print on Demand experiment and it hasn't made a lot of money. But it's a good little book to take with you places and read and think.
