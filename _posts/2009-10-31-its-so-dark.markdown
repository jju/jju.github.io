I can't tell if the sky being dark at 7pm feels normal or aberrational. I know I love it when it's still light out at 10pm. I love it enough that I notice it. And I know I hate the 4 o clock nightfall that will be our fate in another 6 weeks. But this middle zone I'm unsure of. When do I lose my sense of entitlement to light? Rationally it should be around the equinox but that's long past. The snow from a few weeks ago was so good for me. It staved off most of my winter lamenting after it melted and we hit double digit temperatures again.

I spent an hour today ranking all the LSA3 jobs in the WPL system. We'll see if I get to stay at Millennium or if I have to go to some far flung branch when the dust settles. Because of my (lack of) seniority position I get booted from Millennium if there's an influx of two or more people from the branches who decide to come downtown. The Millennium packages have more hours than you get at any branch, so it might be tempting for some people. We'll see what happens. If I have to take a bus to Transcona for 10 hours of work each week I will not be thrilled about work. But on the bright side, I do get to stay out of circulation work.

Today I've been drinking tea and eating homemade ketchup. On food, not straight out of the jar. My tea is just Earl Grey, not fancy 铁观音 like [some people who I'm happy to see've blogged after an extended hiatus](http://hollyrinny.blogspot.com/2009/10/brewing.html).
