TV is way more work than it has any right to be.  Though it's not awful tonight.  Yesterday was far too much, and I had that paper to write as well.  Tonight I just had to do a paper edit and write a script for a 30 second piece I'll be putting together and putting a voiceover on tomorrow.  It's so different from print because there're all these technical and team aspects to worry about on top of the journalism.  I was responsible for three technical fuckups on the story our group was doing yesterday.  I made all our people in the outside shots look green.  I didn't check the mic levels before we recorded our crucial interview.  I was the one that the camera started eating tape on (though that wasn't my fault really).  But it does feel good to be at the helm of a little thing like this.  It's making me want to make movies.  So rather than thinking about that consciousness jumping thing on the DJS5 blog in terms of a comic (though Hassie's idea seems cool as hell, even if I don't quite get it yet) I'm thinking that a hideously nonlinear short film might work.  It'd be tricky no matter what way I think about it.  A John Tynes script I saw once had a kind of similar core to it so I think it could be doable.  I'd pare the idea down to a manageable density.  I don't know.  I've got so much work to do I have to have things like this to kick around in my head so I don't get too school focused.
  

  
Do other people do that?  I mean have a consciously chosen default thing to think about to control your wandering daydreams.  I find that if I have to get anything done it's best to keep my thoughts somewhere I can find them and bring them back to the task at hand, rather than completely losing them.  Like kids going to the playground across the street from their house.  They can have fun, but aren't too far away when supper's ready.  They can go explore the ravine on the weekend.
