It took just under 24 hours to travel through the three gorges and get from Wanzhou to Yichang.  If you look at a map for that and realize that it's all downstream, you'll know exactly which cliche I'm not going to use.

I only really saw two of the gorges because darkness tripped and was sprawled all over the place by the time we got further.  We also seem to have stopped for an hour or two in the middle of the night, but I'm not sure.

The sun rose as we were in the locks coming into Yichang.  I had one of those sleeps where I woke up all the time because I didn't want to be the only person left on the boat when it got to port.  Like on the bus to Chengdu.

We got in this morning and I went straight to the train station to get my ticket to Guangzhou.  My Let's Go book said that it's almost impossible to get tickets directly from the station here, but I had no problems.  The ticketseller even spoke a bit of English.  I leave at 7:02pm and that train ride should be about 14 hours.  Then it's just a couple more hours and I'm in Hong Kong.

If they're having a freakish cold spell I will destroy something beautiful.

(Oh.  I'm having problems accessing my email addresses so I hope you're reading this mom.)
