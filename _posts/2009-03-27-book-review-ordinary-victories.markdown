Also last week I read [Ordinary Victories](http://www.amazon.ca/Ordinary-Victories-Manu-Larcenet/dp/1561634239/) a French comic (translated) by Manu Larcenet. It's another one about a photographer but this one was good. Less action packed than Shutterbug Follies but actually about something, the whole idea of art and work and holding onto things that are disappearing. Change change change. I wanted to live in the main character's house out in the countryside.
