Today was the first day I actually had fun teaching.  It was in this British culture class and I felt like I didn't have to work so hard.  I drew a vague map and talked about fossil fuels and I'm sure they didn't understand a lot of it but I repeated myself and I think a few points got through.  The only shitty part was at the end when I said "read these sections."  It's like 14 pages.  They are university students.  I don't need them to be able to recite it from memory, I told them, just look at it.  It was the greatest hardship they'd ever been subjected to.  Living in China.  Bloody hell.
  

  
I was reading my cousin Troy's [blog](http://tblog.ath.cx/troy/?sid=CjBZ54LVtjlN4Yxf3oT23WhHRVcGbC4MQTB9z) the other day and saw that he's working on a computer RPG project that he needs writers and artists and such for.  One thing I am separated from out here is my traditional geek culture outlets.  No comic shops.  No miniatures.  No gamers.  So I emailed my cousin and am going to do some geek-writing.
