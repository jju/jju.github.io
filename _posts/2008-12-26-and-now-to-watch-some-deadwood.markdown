Merry Xmas. Read this: [Pearls Before Breakfast](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html) (It has nothing to do with Xmas.)

It's been a busy week. Sean's birthday, a Westgate reunion (which felt like "Sean's birthday, some Carcassonne, drinking at the Camby, Xmas Eve jiaozi and a big ol' Xmas Day feast (with a 78-year-old poet).

I may write more about a few of those things tomorrow. For now though, if you have time, read that Washington Post article I linked to above.
