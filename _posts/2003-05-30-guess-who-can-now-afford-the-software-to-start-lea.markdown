Guess who can now afford the software to start learning web design and Flash and stuff? Several people, including me.  'Cause I got a tiny scholarship!  So tiny, it's silly to just use it for tuition, so I will waste it Chinese soup fashion!  Hooray!  And we played our first Ultimate game today and lost.  Hooray!

I also finished my 12 page paper that was assigned last Friday and is due tomorrow.  Now I just have to write up a short news story about a very unnewsy speech I sat through today.  But I will do it, burninating the peasants as I go.
