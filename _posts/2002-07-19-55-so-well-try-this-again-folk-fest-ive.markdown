55
  

  
So, we'll try this again.  Folk Fest.  I've now been twice, and each time I've come away having had a decent time and a couple of good stories to tell those who didn't go, but it's not the kind of thing that makes me go Super Wow!  The two acts that I really enjoyed were fairly non FolkFestish (the Folktronica and the Nosferatu screening).  Everything else (music wise) was just nice background noise if I had shade, but wasn't worth sitting out in the hot sun for.  Yet people really enjoyed some of these acts so I had to keep on trying to find what the big deal is.  And I like hanging out with my friends at the campsite but it's not crazily different from hanging out in Hassie's basement or at the Cambridge.  I guess there are more people and more random things that can go on, but again, I find I always miss the really fun things, or can't recognize them as the really fun things when I'm involved in them.  Example: Jackie lists stargazing at mainstage as a highlight.  I agree that it was fun to make up constellations and shit, but a highlight?  I hadn't thought of it that way.  Other people have talked about the Oh Sister Where Art Thou show, and I was there for that but I don't know which one the "amazing" singer was.  I'm glad that I wasn't with anybody for the Folktronic show or the Nosferatu thing because I know that I liked them and wasn't just liking how much my friends liked them.  I think that's where my Folk Fest enjoyment comes in; I like being with my friends when they are having a good time, even if I'm not quite the same sort of ronin.  That's why I went again this year.  There's a bit of hype that says Folk Fest is Great! and I'll be damned if I'm gonna burst that bubble for the people who really feel that.  It's easy enough after the fact to make it sound like you've had an awesome time.
