[Dr. Bloodmoney](http://www.amazon.ca/Dr-Bloodmoney-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0375719296/) is a postapocalyptic novel. Unlike its [not-quite-namesake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) the bombs get dropped in the first chapter and we never see anyone riding them down into oblivion. But there is a grown up thalidomide baby with psychic powers, a man trying to sell mechanical rat traps, the eponymous doctor who believes he is the cause of all the world's problems, a number of affairs, a talking dog, a girl with a not quite imaginary brother who lives inside her and a spaceman who orbits the planet (with his silent dead wife) after his trip to Mars is interrupted by war with the Chinese. None of the characters were really likeable but that was sort of part of the whole point of the book, that community of any dysfunctional sort was preferable to facing the world and all its madness alone.
