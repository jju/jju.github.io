It's funny how I need a little pressure to get anything done.  Now that I know there are people around who I might want to do stuff with (like J-Dog and Ronny) it means that I actually have to do the work I would otherwise put off.  So I've got a first draft of my next RPG.net column done and the Prairiegrass review/response thingy is almost there.  
  
Just to keep you informed.
