I got back from class to find my apartment all steamed up by a pack of raccoons going at it.  My eyes will never be the same.
  

  
Actually it was all steamed up because one of my external water heater pipes had burst and was spraying hot water all over the kitchen.  I ran down to Wang Quen and told her and she phoned a repairman who seems very ticked off that the pipe had a hole in it and couldn't just be tightened.  I have another leak in my laundry room that I hope he will fix too.
  

  
All of this has forestalled my rant against teaching for a little while.
