I got my first extra shift at the library today.  I'm not sure why so many pages were gone, but there were three of us covering for people.  It's nice not having a whole hell of a lot up during the day to get interrupted with that.  And since I just applied for new positions, I figure it looks good on my internal performance whatevers.  They'll see this and say, "Man this dude wasn't lying when he said he had no problem covering people's shifts.  That is a dude who should not be a mere bookstacker."  And then I will get a job that will give me a bit more of a monetary cushion.  Y'know, instead of having to rely on these three pay period months and a tax return to get me through.  
  
When Hassie got back he was all, "So are you Facebooking yet?"  And I'm not.  I've realized that my problem in life isn't that I need more friends to not talk to.  It may be a whole lot of other things but not that.  ([And I never know what to say in those profiles.](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=963))  Dear friends: I'm sorry for not talking to you more.  
  
Speaking of people I don't talk to, I got an email from one of my former students the other day.  I've been away long enough that it was nice to hear from her, and *gasp* I wrote back.
