[CBC.ca says](http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2004/12/28/tsunamidead041228.html) the death toll from Sunday's tsunami could be over 60,000 people.  I [read this morning](http://alternet.org/envirohealth/20855/) that in total 70,000 people died from tsunamis in the 20th century.  So when does Bush's War on the Planet begin? Oh wait, that's what they're doing fucking around with Kyoto.  
  
Snarkiness aside, [give for the relief effort](http://www.mcc.org/respond/rapid_respond/asiaearthquake/index.html).    
  
I know some people who are in both Indonesia and Sri Lanka working with MCC and they're all safe but [yikes](http://www.soieasy.com/modules.php?set_albumName=Tsunami&id=P1010045&op=modload&name=Pictures&file=index&include=view_photo.php).
