I don't know if you're aware, but I likes me some comics.  (The Supermarket Sweep? Not so much.) I laughed harder at [this Scarygoround punchline](http://www.scarygoround.com/?date=20070420) than I have at anything all week.  And I've hung out with my friends in full offensively funny mode.  That's right, I'm calling out everyone I was in contact with this week for not being funnier than this professional.  For shame!  To be fair, you were funnier than [this Cat & Girl comic](http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=457) which I am quite fond of.     
  
(I'm not really calling you out.  I loves youse guys.)
