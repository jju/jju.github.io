Last night I read the best little book: [Weight by Jeanette Winterson](http://www.amazon.com/Weight-Myth-Atlas-Heracles-Myths/dp/1841957186/). It's a retelling of the Atlas and Heracles myth (short version: Atlas holding the world Heracles needs him to go pick some apples and then tricks Atlas into taking the world again) but every sentence reached into my gut and said "This is how you write a story." 

And in the end Atlas rescues a tiny space-dog just before she's about to be killed. Maybe it's just me, but there seems to have been a lot of Laika loving these days. It's sort of to be expected with the 50 years post Sputnik stuff happening, I guess. I just hope it's okay if I'm cliched enough to want to have something to do with that first space-travelling earthling.

And now it's Christmas. I'm off to Mom's in a bit. We'll end up at Lynette's after church and eat 500 jiaozi. That's how I'll know what season it is.
