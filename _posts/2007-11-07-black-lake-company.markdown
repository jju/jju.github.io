In our Reign game tonight I was both happy to induce some moral anguish and eager to get rid of same. It's not fun to have your characters twisting in the wind because the players don't like what they might do. The thing was that I was just trying to make the company's enemies be a bit recognizable as people who the players could sympathize with. Eventually the tension broke and the players could deal with things without agonizing too much. I've never provoked that kind of stuff before. I sort of feel bad for letting the prisoners try and revolt, and letting the players off the hook, but it's supposed to be fun. Not real life.
