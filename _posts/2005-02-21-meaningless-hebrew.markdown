I'm sure there'll be better obits out there in the next few days, but Hunter S. Thompson [shot himself](http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2005/02/20/Arts/thompson-050221.html) while I was on the train home from Hong Kong.

I try not to fake writing like the gonzo master, cause everybody who does it ends up looking stupid, and the whole point of gonzo was to see what you saw.  But there's no way I can say that his work wasn't a huge influence on me.

It is through his lens that I know anything about the politics of the 60s and 70s.  The Great Shark Hunt ain't a history text, but it does the job of any good piece of journalism: it tells you what he saw.  This is the only kind of journalism that really matters.  What did you see?  That's the only question that journalists should be answering.  It's not about officials and reports, it's about what people experience.  That's what HST did, especially since he tried to experience more than what you and I so easily settle for.


<blockquote>I am guilty, Lord, but I am also a lover - and I am one of your best people, as you know; and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy from time to time and even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarassment to you . . . and if the others have any questions or snide comments about it, tell them to eat shit and die.

There's an essay he wrote when he was young, like in high school, on security.  It's one of those things that I'd send as a forward to everyone I knew if I did that sort of thing.  One of the things that I don't live up to nearly as well as I should.  I would disappoint him if we had ever had the chance to meet.  But it's always been comforting to know the Doctor abides, keeping it crazy for all us sinners.  No longer.

Selah.
