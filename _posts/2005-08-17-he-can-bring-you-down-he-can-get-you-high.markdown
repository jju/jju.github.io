Less than two hours before our bus will be taking us to the airport and I'll begin the long trek back to Wanzhou for another year.  And when I say long trek I mean three hour flight followed by interminable periods of boredom.  
  
I'm packed, though zippers could explode at any time (if they were 30 kuai Chinese backpacks - since they're like 900 kuai Canadian bought [possibly Indonesian manufactured] MEC bags I've got a little more faith in em).  The bag I brought expressly for carting books back from BJ is filled past the chock line.  
  
Hopefully Miss Hu or Miss Wang will be at the airport to pick us up.  The Eggmans and I have sent them the flight information.  We'll probably be spending the night in luxurious downtown Chongqing before heading to Ten Thousand Town on Thursday.  
  
Last night we soaked in our last bit of culture for probably the next year.  At a university bar/coffeehouse we saw The Tribesmen play.  Three acoustic guitars and a djembe.  Fuckin A.  Classical guitaring, a dancing strum hand and all of it really really loud. It had a very latin kind of feel.  I almost felt like starting up a junta.  Damn that General Tapioca.  Back stabbing son of a bitch.
