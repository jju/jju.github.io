Tonight I get on the train to small-town Victoria again to do some training at a regional health library. Woo! Actually that's not even a sarcastic woo, because Holly's going to come too. She has to take an earlier train back than me so she can get to work on time (stupid-early-o-clock) but I'm going to be working anyway. 

Maybe we won't exhaust all the excitement Shepparton has to offer right away, but if we do, Holly'll get to at least spice it up by driving. We're renting a car and while she can legally drive here, I don't have a license for Australia (apparently you can use your North American one for three months, which I have been here longer than).

This is sort of a warmup for December when we're planning a bit more extensive roadtripping up to my friend Mel's place and maybe inland a ways. I like deserts.

Other than this excitement, things are just ticking along. Holly made Chinese noodles last night that tasted very approximately like the noodles you get everywhere in Nanchong. She's in charge of that kind of cooking - specific cooking. My technique is more "Let's combine a bunch of stuff and see what happens" which isn't untasty, but it's hard to know how to make something happen.

I'm reading a bunch of SF&F books for [the class I'm taking](http://librarianaut.com/tag/libr593/), which is a fun way to spend my time. Not that I didn't enjoy my recent social media class, but reading about Vikings and faery and space travel and thinly veiled Christian allegories is a much nicer way to spend a Saturday.
