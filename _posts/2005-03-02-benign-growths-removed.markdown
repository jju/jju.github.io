It is a nice feeling to have a short workweek.  It's like I go Monday (first workday), Thursday (woohoo tomorrow is my last workday), Friday (I like weekends).  In essence I've excised Tuesday and Wednesday from my week and replaced them with extra Saturdays.  Everyone should have this kind of schedule.  
  
In other news I think that the restaurants around the school have been using a bad batch of tofu.  I ate at one of my favourite places last Saturday and spent Sunday near the toilet.  The next time I ate tofu was last night and again I had an oft-interrupted sleep that left my toilet bowl thinly spattered like I was some hopeless junkie.  Or are hopeless junkies constipated all the time?  Maybe it was spattered like I was a really optimistic and sunny-dispositioned junkie.  
  
I hope it was just an isolated thing and my body hasn't rejected tofu for all time (like my tastebuds seem to have done with ramen noodles).
