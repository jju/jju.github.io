Today has been such a nice day. I got my paper for my Instructional Role class finished last night, so today was a day of rest. And by rest I mean games. There's a game store, [Strategies](http://www.strategiesgames.ca/), a walkable distance from my house here and on Friday when it was so beautiful in the afternoon I headed down there and picked up the new Space Hulk card game. 

I love Space Hulk a healthy amount. The actual board/[miniatures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/3956605819/) game is one of my favourite games ever, because of its incessant against-all-odds drama. The card game captures a good amount of that in a more abstract manner. You're still controlling a squad of armoured marines in a derelict space ship filled with aliens that'll claw you to pieces at a moment's notice. But there's no map, just areas you travel through, with terrain for genestealers to spawn in. 

The main reason I picked it up was because it can be played with 1-6 people and it's cooperative. When we play regular Space Hulk one person is the Genestealers and it's always kind of a hard thing because you sort of instinctively root for the humans. In the card game all the humans are a team against the cruel cards of fate. It works pretty well. I've played solitaire twice now to get a handle on the rules and one game was very quick and deadly to me (100% mortality in the third room), but I achieved victory in the other one.

The other part of my day was spent painting Blood Bowl figures. Well, they're actually a Celt warband, but I didn't give them any weapons and posed them like football players. They were much cheaper than actual Blood Bowl figs. I'd put these guys together months ago when I was making Sean's wedding present, but hadn't gotten around to painting them. But Strategies is having a Blood Bowl tournament in a couple of weeks. If my homework stays on schedule I might be able to go play. It's been years since I played Blood Bowl so I want to be ready.

Now I get to laze away my evening and count my weekend a success.
