Yesterday was Teacher's Day.  I really like that it's early enough in the year that your students don't really know how much they like you.  I got some presents including a really slick lighter and a bunch of cards.
  

  
The day before yesterday Margie won an award for being a Top Quality foreign teacher in Chongqing Municipality.  Evidently it was a big deal.  We had a banquet with the Foreign Affairs Office and the heads of the English Department and the president of our college last night to celebrate.
