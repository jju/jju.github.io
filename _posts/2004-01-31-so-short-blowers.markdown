I'm leaving balmy Winnipeg for fakeLondon this morning.  So pretend you're me and go to Stevie G's house for a road trip blessing.  I know that the lack of one is why I got in my accident in December.
  

  
Also, listen to DNTO on CBC Radio 1 at 4pm Saturday Jan 31 to hear my Pope vs Batman piece.
