A condensed transcript:

<blockquote>Amber is your jacket. You're very lucky. I had an orange car once from Grease but I shredded it and now I'm just a lawyer making $225 an hour. That must be nice to be rich you and I won't be but you can't have anything unless you're rich and you're the colour of Or. Colour psychology, you know. Green is for soldiers and their pants. Red is gynecology. And look up, there you are with your beard and you can't play Mrs. Doubtfire with a beard. I was once like you living in all that Or but you have to choose one or the other or else it's No Law. You wouldn't survive that very well. And look at that light there you are right in the middle hanging there. When it changes when it changes just wait a moment and you'll see. Do you see any orange cars out there? No. And that's why I shredded it and I'm glad. And you have to choose because they won't let you Or forever. I hope you find another one.</blockquote>

She wandered away in Portage place.
