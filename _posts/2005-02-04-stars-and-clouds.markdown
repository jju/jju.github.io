Last night I went out taking pictures.  It'll be a while till I get back to upload any onto flickr but there should be some neat stuff.  The glow the Island skyline makes from within the clouds is pretty neat.
  

  
There's an avenue of stars on the waterfront that has names and handprints of HK movie stars.  They've got lots of old ones (who didn't leave handprints) plus the ones you'd expect to be there (Jackie Chan, John Woo, Michelle Yeoh).  I was a little surprised that Zhang Yimou wasn't out there, but realized he's mainland Chinese.  Chow Yun Fat and Wong Kar Wai both have stars out there but no handprints.
  

  
It's not raining today so I'm heading out to explore.
