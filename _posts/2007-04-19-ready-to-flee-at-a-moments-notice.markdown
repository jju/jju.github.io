My passport arrived today!  It feels much thinner than my old one.  Primarily because there's a noticeable absence of stickers and stamps inside.    
  
Also, a "You didn't get the job!" notice arrived today from the City of Winnipeg.  So no River Heights Library for me.  I have a feeling those notices will start coming every week now, since I applied for a tonne of jobs with closing deadlines seven days apart.  
  
I kind of laugh at how my work situation has worked out since I returned from China.  I applied for a bazillion little newspaper jobs (bazillion may equal a dozen).  Didn't hear back from any of them.  Oh good for me.  I'd probably hate that anyway.  I get told, "Dude, I can totally hook you up with freelance CBC Radio work" so I decide to move into Alison's and stick around the city.  That work never materializes.    
  
Then I realize my money will run out eventually and apply at the library, where I get in!  Yay!  I should hope I get this job as I'm insanely overqualified for it.  I hope to follow in Andrea's footsteps and be a lowly page for a very short amount of time, as the pay is just enough to get me by until I get my hours cut by a third when summer begins.  But it can't be that hard to get something else; I'm in the system and that's the main thing, right?  It's now three months in and I can't get anything better than stacking books.  I've got two weeks left before I lose my Sunday shifts.  Ha ha ha.
