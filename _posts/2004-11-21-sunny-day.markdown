It was a beautiful day so I went out walking to find the kite-flyers that I'm almost positive I've mentioned before.    
  
These aren't the kinds of little quick darting cheap construction kites that Reyn and I watched in India.  These are big contraptions that seem just right for attaching people to and sending them into space.  
  
The kites hang in the air about a million miles above you, which is neat when you are halfway up a mountain and see kites from the river flying above you, but makes for shitty pictures with my little camera.  
  
I hear Jamie Foxx is playing a kite guy in his next movie.
