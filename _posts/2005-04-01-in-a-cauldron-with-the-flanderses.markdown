I was going to post a big long thing about how I got called into the office today to get reamed out for having a guest in class on Monday.  I was going to tell you how my mom's friend from Winnipeg came and talked about her experiences which wasn't bad but when she asked the students questions about farming well, that was the line.  And about how I've been given a teaching monitor who'll be sitting in my classes to make sure I toe that line from now on.
  

  
But I decided not to waste the effort because who'd believe me if I told you all that today?
