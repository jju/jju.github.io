My mom is off to France, heck, she might even be there soon, and I am done school for the term. Many of my classmates are now done school for good, which is a little weird. Weird that we don't all finish together, I mean. I don't have the great cathartic sighs of relief, since I've still got two and a third classes over the next four months. Plus doing interviews for a book we're working on. 

The good thing is that remaining a student leaves me able to work in Graduate Research Assistant positions over the next few months. I'll hopefully be doing a bunch of video production work for one of my profs, and right now I'm doing a whack of content management stuff for SLAIS' new MA in Children's Literature website (which isn't up yet).

The wonderful bit about this kind of work is that I can do it on my own with a baseball game on. The Jays have new uniforms and hey, maybe this is the year they'll play meaningful September ball. I enjoyed the hell out of their first victory of the season yesterday, but really, I just like watching games.

I was looking at my history of being here in Vancouver and I noticed that this month till the summer classes begin is my first time I've really spent in Vancouver without school going on. I ran off to China and Australia at the ends of my previous semesters, so I'm going to have to remember that there isn't any meeting with people in my classes that will just happen because I'm sitting in a chair near somewhere they are going. If I'm going to see my friends I have to contact them. Which will be difficult but I'll do my best. It's a time for hope.
