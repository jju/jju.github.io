Remember how I thought I'd either drowned or cooked my giant spider in the bathroom when I got back to my apartment?  Maybe I didn't mention it here.  Well in that case all you need to know is that I fought a round against a giant spider (as big as my fucking hand) when I arrived on Thursday.  I thought I'd either cooked or drowned it, but as in all good action movies I didn't go searching for the corpse to confirm the kill.  
  
That came back to haunt me tonight.  
  
Earlier this evening J-Dog mentioned that he'd seen a huge spider behind my toilet.  I told him the story and he said "Oh good it's dead then."  He hadn't seen it move or anything so we assumed that all was well with the world.  
  
Jump to 12:15am when I was getting ready to go to bed, and needed to piss voluminously.  What do I see but two legs on the wall sticking up past the toilet tank.  I knew that the corpse did not move up there to dry itself out for spider mummification.  Possibly the roaches moved it, but I decided to use that only as my secondary hypothesis.  
  
The question facing me was whether to try and take a piss without it noticing (which would have involved getting close enough to the toilet to lift the lid - I may be a male living alone but I always put the toilet seat down) or have a terrifying fight to the death.  I decided to fight.  Primarily because I wanted this thing dead for sure by the next time I needed to take a dump.  
  
I put on my boots.  
  
Knowing spiders have a weakness for being washed out of spouts I began by throwing hot water at it from a small pot.  It scurried up from behind the toilet tank into the corner of the ceiling where I needed to aim more carefully, which was difficult because I was trying my best not to look at it.  It must have known it was dealing with a person who could be intimidated by the sight of a spider as big as my fucking hand.  
  
Some of my attacks seemed to hit it though because it came down the wall about halfway.  That was when I got hold of the showerhead and turned it onto the foul beast, pressing it down into the corner on the floor behind the toilet brush.  This was the same position it had found refuge in on Thursday but something must have told it that Sundays are not days for taking prisoners and it charged me.  It charged me.  
  
You might think this was a pretty unequal fight, me with my hot water and boots, my access to a broom and such, and what did this poor defenseless creature have?    
  
Terror, pure and simple.  That would be my terror, fuelled by its giant creepy legs and ugly hairy body.  This was no William Wallace charging an enemy it could not defeat just for the sake of its freedom.  Never feel sorry for it.  I was the one who was brave.  
  
I slowed down its charge with scalding water and clipped it with my broom.  It tried climbing the side of the bowl but it was too slow and I washed it back down the side to the floor where I could smash it again with the broom.  I was not going to be satisfied with some literary spout death for this gigantic perversion of all that is good in the world.    
  
Once it realized it was beaten it made one last desperate attempt to grab onto the broom that I was flailing it with.  I could see its plan was to climb up the length and bring the fight into its own reach.  I gave the broom a shake and stomped.  And stomped and stomped.  
  
And stomped.  Until I was sure it was dead.  
  
The water was still running so I tried flushing the corpse down my drain, but remembered that the itsy bitsy spider crawled up the spout again.  So I swept it up into its own separate garbage bag.  It's dead.  I can defecate freely again.  
  
That bag is far too heavy.
