Kid Koala is an inspiring dude.  I may not have his talent (and any version of Blue River I ever make will be nothing compared to his) but damnit I'm going to try make cool things.  
  
If you look at my flickr pics regularly you'll recognize this picture from when I uploaded the original.  I was crossing the Osborne bridge and saw this poster for a show I was going to.  And hey, the ice path on the river was pretty freshly cleared.  That might make an okay picture, thought I.  I only had my phone so I snapped a quick one but the intention was to return in a couple of days when more people were skating and when I had my real camera.  
  
Last night on my way to the show, I crossed the bridge again, and lo, the posters were missing.  Firk Ding Blast! I exclaimed and realized I'd have to do something to the 640x480 grayish blurfest my phone habitually produces.  
  
Actually I kind of like working with the Treo's crappy pictures.  It means I have to play with Photoshop to make them look like anything.  Makes me feel like more of a painter or something.  
  
Whatever.  That's my story and my picture.
