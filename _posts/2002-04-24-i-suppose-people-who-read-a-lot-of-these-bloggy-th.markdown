I suppose people who read a lot of these bloggy things that are written by procrastinating university students get sick of hearing about the author's exams and how difficult they are and how much they think they are going to fail, undsoweiter.  So to provide some contrast: I've got two exams left in my degree and they're going to be a breeze!  A+s all around!  Hooray for everything!  But then I'm just an arts student, as all those "ambitious" people who want to "be able to do something productive with their degree" will tell you.  Mieh.
