I had my first banquet as visiting foreign teacher tonight.  It was okay.  Nobody forced anything weird onto my plate or challenged me to serious drinking (which I would die from.  Seriously.  The Chinese drink, and skinny little me would have his guts strewn about the floor quickly).  Lots of toasts were made, including one by me.  
  

  
Supposedly my students tell Adi, who works in the English department as kind of the foreign teacher liaison, that I'm a funny teacher.  It comes from the howling in class.  I was demonstrating the difference between "making a fuss" and "vowing to fight something."  Like, they both mean you disagree, but it's question of severity.  So I was acting it out by saying I'd make them all come to an extra class that evening and force them to do three times as much homework and was putting words in their mouths and it was kind of fun.  It meant we didn't actually get any time to talk about the point of the article, but what can you do?
