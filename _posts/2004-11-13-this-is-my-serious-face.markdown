I wasn't sure if I'd get it here, but I just saw [Team America: World Police](http://imdb.com/title/tt0372588/).  It's a theatre bootleg (ie not a ripped DVD), but a relatively good copy.  Colour's all washed off but that's about it.  It was pretty funny, but not amazing.  I knew all the good bits beforehand which made them all seem really short.  I wanted more of the Pearl Harbour sucked song.  Actually, my favourite part was Spottswoode making Gary suck his dick to prove the trust issue but that was probably because it was the only major joke I hadn't already read about.  Selah.
