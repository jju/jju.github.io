After storytime on Wednesday one of the kids had a huge tantrum about wanting to read books at the library instead of going home and going to bed. It was after I was done with them though, so I could laugh and laugh.

On Monday Art's offering my position to the woman he interviewed this past week and if she accepts (which seems likely) I'll be able to leave for the Falcon, hooray!

Today I was cutting out handouts for Baby Rhyme Time that Targ left for whoever to do. The funny part of it is that for some reason she didn't print them two to a sheet. So each of these little things gets cut out, leaving a good 60% of a page behind on each to either go into recycling or the mound of scrap paper she's building on the desk (possibly for some sort of nest). I wanted to leave this BRT waste stabbed to her desk with a note saying "This is on your head, Treeslayer!" That's probably because I'm reading A Game of Thrones though. Instead, I left a Post-It saying "You know, there'd be less waste if you printed these two to a sheet."

Last night I talked to Holly and Phil on Skype, all videoed up and everything. It is pretty neat living in the future.
