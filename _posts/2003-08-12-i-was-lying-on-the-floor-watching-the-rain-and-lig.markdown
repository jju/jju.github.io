I was lying on the floor watching the rain and lightning this afternoon and I was thinking about [Campaign](http://www.aratar.mb.ca/main.stm).  I'm looking forward to hanging out down there in the next few weeks.  There's been a bunch of staff turnover.  According to the webpage there's a new manager.  Acting at least.
  

  
Now I can't find my glasses.
