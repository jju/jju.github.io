Mom and I took a trip out to Niverville on Sunday. My grandma's moving into not-exactly-a-nursing home out there on Tuesday. We were bringing a truck-load of her smaller things, dishes clothes knicknacks and such. Grandma's going to be on a floor where there's a bit of security so that the inhabitants who don't know exactly where or who they are can't go wandering out and down the street. We had a good time playing "spot the person with dementia" which is very simple by Mom's rules; anyone who doesn't respond to her friendly hello with an immediate chummy conversation is obviously demented.
