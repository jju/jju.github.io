So I've been back in Vancouver a week and been busy busy busy. I have a lot of stuff to do every day, transcribing the interviews I did out east, keeping up with the Teen Reading Club stuff and getting paid to work on elearning videos. It's funny how the last one is the hardest to get to and that's the one that actually brings in money. I guess part of it is that I've also got to keep those hours down and it's entirely possible for me to get lost in editing video until the world ends. If I'm judicious about when I start that kind of thing it means I'll be able to juggle the less fun work too.

Sean and Jenn were in town last weekend and though I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I'd have liked we did have a good sports day (baseball and football) followed by a science morning. I had never been to Science World, though that golfball building has been my iconic image for Vancouver since I was six. It was a lot of fun. The DaVinci exhibit, filled with replicas of devices made from his notebooks, was there and we wandered slowly through. It was the part of Science World where we had to elbow the fewest kids out of the way. They had a whole room dedicated to blown up pictures of the Mona Lisa, all colour-corrected and infra-red viewed, but my favourite part was the actual sized replica of the back of the painting. There's an inexplicable H and other scrawls. Even though it's not the real thing, it felt good seeing something new.

I'm applying for jobs. There's a great Community Outreach Librarian job in Calgary that came up that I really want. A similar one went up in Edmonton too. And there are positions open in the public library back in Sydney. I doubt I'd get any of those, since they probably aren't going to be as trusting of a Skype interview as a techy place like Prosentient was, but I'm applying. And I'll keep applying here in Vancouver. It just feels like here everything is so temporary. There's a great job that I could maybe get for a year but then I'd have to find a new job when a year is up. Which isn't the worst thing in the world. Flexibility is a virtue and all that.
