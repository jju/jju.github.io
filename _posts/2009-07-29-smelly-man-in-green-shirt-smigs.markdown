At the desk today Beard Lady was talking about The Silence of the Lambs being a series and I pointed out she meant sequel and she went off on a thing about how "seeing isn't intelligence, all this stuff here the library is intelligence, written in words" and then she told me the tale of her copyright she has in the 1969 Houghton Mifflin Canadian Dictionary and how that put the cops on her. "Once you have copyrights that's it for you. The cops are all over you." She tried to explain about how that dictionary is different from the fourth edition of the American Heritage Dictionary which someone tried to get her to use once but she opened it up and was "lost. I'd memorized my dictionary the one I wrote and now I need my philology."

We were interrupted by a guy she knew who was telling her about how the public pools were being taken away in favour of waddling pools. Well, she read "waddling pools" of his paper. I would imagine it said "wading pools." They also talked a bit about Michael Jackson and how good he looked at the end. "Of course it was murder," she said. "When you have all that money and your nose is that sharp of course they kill you." In any case she found the waddling pools funny and kept repeating it to stretch out its absurdity, but the guy didn't so much. "They're just taking things away from you and me and giving it to children," he pouted. She promised to help and he stalked away somewhat mollified. She explained that they'd worked together at D.O. (I don't know what that means) for three years and got paid $0.75/hour to keep their welfare cheques coming.

And then she was back on the meanings of words and wanted a list of every movie we had in the library that had been edited for television so she could watch it without the pornography. She didn't remember Ghostbusters having pornography in it when she saw it on TV, you see, but when she watched the DVD there it was. I explained how most DVDs have more stuff put on, not stuff taken out.

For beard lady the definition of insanity (today) is change. "Could you imagine what would happen if Elvis changed?" she asked rhetorically, to which I completely butted in and answered, "But he did. There's skinny Elvis and fat Elvis." She stared at me. "And that's why he's dead." 

"Elvis spent $40000 on his hair and that meant he couldn't wash it or shower or go out in the rain or swim in his pool..." I interrupted again, "I'm sure he was buoyant enough to swim with his head above water."

She lost interest in me about then and I had a very quiet rest of my shift.
