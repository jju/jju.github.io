[Chinese men smoking themselves to death](http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/04/27/cancer-china.html):

<blockquote>At Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, an ashtray overflows with damp cigarette butts placed under a no smoking sign.  
  
Dr. Zhou Caicun of the hospital's oncology department said he is embarrassed by the ashtrays at the hospital, which has four floors of lung cancer patients.</blockquote>

Oh to ride a Chinese bus again.
