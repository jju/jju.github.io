From Kate, our correspondent in Montreal:
  

  
"Guys!!! This is so freakin' cool! Right now, from my window, i can see tons of cop cars, and there's helicopters, and the streets are blocked off, and there has been a 
  
kidnapping!!!!! and the people are being held in a house just down my street! apparantly two people from toronto were kidnapped and brought here, to freakin' WESTMOUNT, and last night one of them escaped and contacted the police, and so now there are cops all over the 'hood."
