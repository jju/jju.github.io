Out walking with Myrrl and Margie today I met the first Chinese girl that I wanted to bring back to Canada with me.  She's articulate and cute and happens to be a nun.  Yep.  My first Chinese crush is already a bride of Christ.  Bastard Jesus.  Getting all the cool chicks.  
  
[She and Myrrl](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/1260315/) were talking about the Diocese and this famous bishop that Wanzhou used to have and all I could think of was how I never hear anyone talk about church people being "the faithful."  I loved how it sounded when she said it.  
  
So I might be attending a few more masses in the next while.
