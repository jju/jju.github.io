This'll be the first and last post on the subject, but I'm doing the [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) thing.  I heard about this last year on DNTO.  The idea is that people around the world (so yes it should be International) each write a novel between November 1st and 30th.    
  
It's based on quantity, not quality.  You're just supposed to write 50,000 words.  It's accepted that they'll all be shitty novels, but they'll be closer than most people get to being a writer.  And as I have problems motivating myself to write, I hope this'll mean I get a first draft of something I can take apart and rewrite after the month is over.  
  
I get depressed looking at the forums over at the NaNoWriMo website because it seems like it's all just highschool kids doing this, and I'd rather not be lumped in with all those whiny 15-year-old wannabe writers doing their vampire stories.  But whatever.  Maybe it's fitting.
