After many fits and starts 3dWorlder is at a point where to move forward I have to make up new things. I've been cleaning things up and getting mad at how much they suck for the last couple of months, but now I've done that to the parts of the book that were finished and I have to come to terms with the ending. The book has an ending right now, but it's a bit of a fall off the cliff kind of thing. Not quite a Deus Ex but uncomfortably close. Kind of abrupt.

Before the month is done it's going to get turned into a real ending. And then I will be done with this thing for a while. Will move on to something new. It's been way too much time on this slight little story already. I think that the only good part of it as it stands now is the first chunk, which is both too long and too short to sell on its own. But I'm going to finish it for real before April. 

It's so hard to work on something when you have no deadline at all.
