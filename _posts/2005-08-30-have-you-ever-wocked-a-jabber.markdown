I was a model for a few hours this morning as Ronny was testing his new camera.  I sexed it up real good but he still told me to lose thirty pounds.
  

  
And it looks like I will have a couch in my new apartment.  O frabjous day!  Evidently my bed will not have a mattress so that's double good.
  

  
I'm trying to figure out how this new apartment thing is going to work.  I love the space itself, but I'm thinking my sense of personal space that I have now is rapidly going to deteriorate.  I may have occasionally complained about having no one around, but I'm going to have to work very hard to keep this blog from turning into complaining about having people around.
  

  
Already my conversations are turning into those awful gossippy things that seem to typify people in insular communities.  I am going to have to put a stop to that.
