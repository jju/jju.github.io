At work I was shelf reading (also known as reorganizing the things that idiot patrons mess up through their "use" of the books) in the 900 section.  I love the boundary number areas.  Today's example: Going from the 919.8s which are about Antarctica (and explorers of said continent) to the four books we have in 919.9 which are about space exploration, to the 920s: Biographies.  What is the connection there?    
  
I also was sorting some books on a cart and got two books (about the I Ching or something) next to each other with call numbers that were 194.325 JON and 194.325 WOO.  I smiled.  Oh and Miss America from 1995 has the name Whitestone, but on the spine of her biography our library tag has it split into three lines like so:

<blockquote>B  
WHITEST  
ONE</blockquote>

(The B is for biography.)
