I love the tofu here.  It's so much better than Canadian tofu.  And you buy it from people who slice off as much as you need like in a deli.  It's so much better than the blood that I keep on mistaking for tofu (because it too is congealed into nice sliceable chunks), or the chicken feet.  Eel is also surprisingly good.  I like it better than the fish I've eaten here.  It tastes more like you're eating a rope, but in a good way.  
  
It doesn't often smell like India here except for just down the hall I teach most of my classes in.  Where the stagnant wall of ick kind of hits you and is left quickly behind.  I wonder how much that washroom is used in a day.  
  
It's been cool for the past couple of days since we had a big thunderstorm and the rain lasted all night.  I wondered if that meant that fall was here, but Margie says it's hard to tell.  We could get another heat wave any day.  
  
I realize I've been pimping the hell out of it, but do you like my flickr badge in the sidebar?  It's supposed to be showing you three random pictures I've got loaded in the flickr system.  They'll keep 100 pictures visible at any one time, so if you like any of those ones and think they should have a more permanent home, comment on them and I'll save some more of them for posterity in the pictures section here.  I like flickr's tag system, and surprisingly there's no tag for poor choices.  On my computer right now I've got lots of great pictures that could be called exactly that.
