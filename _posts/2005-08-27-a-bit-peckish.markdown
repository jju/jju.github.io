Last night the Eggmans and Margie and I went to the restaurant in Wanzhou that actually has an English menu.  I actually took the initiative to organize such an event.  Basically 'cause I figure'd the Eggmans would enjoy knowing there's a place where they don't have to rely on someone else to order for them.
  

  
Of course, this meant that it was a huge long exercise in dithering to get any ordering done.  I think it's years of vegetarianism that made me really efficient at restaurants.  There're only so many things to choose from so you get good at finding and picking one.  And when you're ordering for yourself you can take responsibility if you try something new that sucks.  There's no pressure.
  

  
But with a group of people, jeez.  Nobody wants to make any decisions.  And when I'm hungry I like decisions to get made, but don't want to be the asshole who's saying "Let's get a move on here!"  It just bothers me having serving staff hovering, waiting for your order when no one's at all ready, and won't get ready.
  

  
Maybe I just eat by myself too often.
