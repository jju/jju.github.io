It's vaguely Christmassy in my apartment tonight.  And all through the simple expedient of mixing processed fake orange juice with Sprite.  Like so many half assed festive punches I have drunk in my younger years.

On an unrelated note baijiu sucks as a vodka substitute when you are making Christmas punch.

It's funny how much smarter better at English the first-years in my Reading class are than my American culture kids.  I also realized that I'll have to teach them (the first-years) something real, since the rest of their studies could be affected by how well they learn to be good readers.  Which is something approaching pressure.

Last semester the seniors were practically done anyway and nothing would try to build on reading newspapers.  And no one cares what crap I tell the Culture kids.  It's kind of weird.  Now I actually have to get good at this.

And if anyone cares, Nanchongren just means person from Nanchong (literally Nanchong-person).
