On the local CBC TV news last night the owner of the Palomino club was blaming last weekend's shooting down at the Empire on "the hip hop music and the undesirable people it attracts." I love that some people actually talk like befuddled suit-wearing men from the sixties sometimes. That we haven't moved as far beyond it as you might think if you live on the internet.

Tangentially related, I've also noticed a lot more of the stereotypical Canadian accent in the last year. Well, since I started working at the library. You think it's just horribly exaggerated that no one really talks like the slow kid from Canada, but lots of people do. People who seem to watch a lot of TV too, so it's not that they aren't exposed to Hollywoodstandard English.
