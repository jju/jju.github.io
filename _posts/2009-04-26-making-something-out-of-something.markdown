On Friday I buckled down and worked. Not on any of my work that needs doing (I get scared of my book from time to time because I suck) but on Grandma's birthday video. It's funny how lost I can actually get in making something. How fast time can go. This doesn't happen to me all the time. Even when I'm dicking about on the internet I feel aware of each and every second I'm frittering away.

In the end Final Cut and I got Grandma's movie sorted out and put on a VHS tape for her. Oh VHS, you are such an ugly horrible medium.

I don't know exactly why my regular Saturday shift begins at 9:15 with a break at 9:45. I suppose there's a reason for it somewhere but it's odd. Note I didn't say "I'm sure" because I do work for the city. Right now we're only allowed to have three people on-desk at a time, meaning one person at least is banished into the lightless cells at any given time. This is so we don't appear to be inefficient in our department and have our hours cut back in these "tough economic times." Supposedly if there is to be a cutting back of hours everyone's positions are re-posted and it is a horrible seniority-based free for all to grab something resembling your job. I hope that doesn't happen.

Although if it did happen it might provide me a kick start. Mom and I were talking the other day about my September trip to China along with Holly's bakery she's opening (isn't that awesome? A bakery!) , and Mom said something like "I keep on expecting you to run off to China again." And I told her that if I could go without teaching I would. But until I completely lose my memory of how much I disliked teaching I probably won't go. It's a choice I'm going to be working with for forever probably: choosing between a job I hate with a life I enjoy vs this grey okayness of work and life. Hm. when I put it that way it seems like hardly a choice at all.

But in the greyness there are the occasional nice evenings like last night with Aileen and Alison that make me forget about the rest of the time. And next week I'm going to Calgary. That promises to be a good time.
