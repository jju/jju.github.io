Saturday was a really nice day.  I played some Necromunda at Dave's (see reports and pictures from a couple of games at the [Underhive: Stacksburg blog](http://stacksburg.blogspot.com) if you care - not all of the battles have been reported yet) and then Steveo and I had dinner and watched Arrested Development.  I spent a quiet rest of the evening at home and then got up to go to work today after not getting a hold of Reyn to see about getting a ride to church for his talk with the Peace & Justice class about his work in Botswana.  
  
My job would be a great job for one of those super-speed reading people.  You have a reason to handle books on lots of different subjects.  Were you aware that cookbooks are one of the highest turnover sections in Millenium's nonfiction domain?  
  
Yeah, I refer to my workplace as Millenium.
