It's warm!  I was walking around today without wearing a sweater and loving each moment of it.
  

  
I also went to the Science Museum which was kind of crappy compared to the other great ones I've been frequenting around here.  In fact I've pretty much exhausted the big cultural sights.  But with the weather turning nice there're wonderful parks to hang out in and it's all good.
  

  
Have I mentioned there are game stores here?  Before heading out to the wilderness for this conference I'm picking up the Japanese edition of Settlers of Catan.  I could get the English or German one, but I know the rules and this one has differently styled components.
  

  
In some ways it's good that Wanzhou has nothing for me to buy.  It means I've got money here to make impulsive purchases.  Like the new Murakami novel that I'd had no idea was coming Kafka on the Shore.  I'm doing my best not to read it right now, but it's so damned hard.
