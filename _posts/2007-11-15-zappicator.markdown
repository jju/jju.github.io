Yesterday I was at work and shelved a book. Many books. One was special. This is what it said on the cover:

<blockquote>The Prevention for All Cancers
Includes a three week program for curing cancer; also a program for **pets**.
With case studies for syncrometer tests. Plus simple instructions to make a zapper, plate zapper, zappicator and homeographic drops.</blockquote>

There was also a person whistling the Super Mario theme really loudly down the terrace. Possibly as a signal. More likely to be annoying. Remember how Nathan Kliewer always played the Simpsons theme whenever he was in a room with a piano? That's what this whistling reminded me of.

In a book I flipped open while shelf reading the following quote jumped at me:

<blockquote>At its best, art is dogmatic eccentric and propagandist.
- Edward de Bono</blockquote>

I didn't like it. The fact it was in the 155s with all the personality testing books and Andrew Weil stuff didn't make me trust its conclusions about art either. This morning I read a line about an artist that is different. 

<blockquote>Anne Laplantine is an artist, which means she thinks in unexpected and original ways with her emotions, and shows us the results of that thinking in pictures and music.</blockquote>

But now that I look at it more carefully, that doesn't really address the propagandistic nature of art itself. And hers might be considered that. If you care, [here's the link](http://imomus.livejournal.com/329884.html) to where I read that line.
