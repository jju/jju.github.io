I should have blogged yesterday, but instead I decided to sleep a lot.  I'm not exactly sure why.  It's not like I've been doing anything to recuperate from.  Maybe I'm just building up a stockpile of rest so that when Things Happen I'll be ready to go.  
  
Tomorrow I'm giving a guest lecture at a middle school (which is a high school in non-Chinese speak).  It's about campus life at Canadian high schools.  "What is school like? What do students do in their spare time?"  That kind of thing.    
  
One big difference is that in Canada, high school students wouldn't (be forced to) show up to a 2 hour lecture by some foreign guy on a Saturday night.  But otherwise, my Westgate experiences are perfectly standard examples of high school the likes of which everyone in Canada experiences.  
  
I wonder how well the word Cotch will translate.
