I read this book on recommendation by Aileen. Not this book specifically; she just told me to read something by Irene Nemirovsky and for some reason Millennium has a billion copies of [Fire in the Blood](http://www.amazon.ca/Fire-Blood-Irene-Nemirovsky/dp/0676979815/). It's pretty and simple and sad, about an older man who lives in a house in the forest. He watches his cousin's daughter get caught up in what could be a scandal if it was known. All about secrets and sullen places and youth. I will be reading more of her work.
