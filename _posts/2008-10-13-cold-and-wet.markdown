Felt weird at work today saying Happy Thanksgiving to people. Not that I said it to anyone, but hearing people say Happy Thanksgiving felt weird. We had a sort of Thanksgiving last night. I ate too much food and realized how much my stomach must have shrunk in the past X amount of time. I had a plate and a half of food plus dessert and I didn't feel ill, I was just in pain. Those poor tissues being pulled apart down in my gut. It took a few hours for the pain to stop. I filled part of them watching a bit of the Rays-Sox game on Mom's big new HD TV. Those things really make moving pictures pretty. I didn't find out who won until this morning though.

I biked to work today. In the rain and the cold. I had a complete change of clothes along so I'd be dry during the day, but as 5pm drew ever closer the dread of my wet clammy biking clothes filled me. Dread for those first few minutes before you get into the ride and the exertion is building up some heat of its own, when all you can feel is cold wet cloth clinging to your skin. When I got home I went straight into the shower for about 20 minutes to pump up the temp in my extremities again.
