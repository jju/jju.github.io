_   I don't want to turn on my fellow human, I really don't.  But I saw these people believing everything they saw on the TV. Everything.  They believe that the Smiler is a good man.  They believe in God. They believe in justice. They believe in Knight Rider.  
  

  
  These people are the Enemy.  Upgrade your sexual organs today, so that we may leave them behind._
