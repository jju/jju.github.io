I got the last variable in the plans for the next year nailed down yesterday. Nailed down in the form of another rejection, but one that was well-expected. I applied to UBC's Creative Writing MFA program again, and again I didn't get in. So I don't have to think about the costs of going back to school in September. And that ended all the plans I had for leaving this frigid city I don't really love. My plans for the future now stand unladen with any expectation of anything happening. Sigh.

Of course, that's not true. Things happen. Two weeks from today I'll be on my way to Nanjing for a month. And the plan is to head west and south in September on a good ol' road trip. I'll watch a lot of baseball this summer. That's enough, right? That's sort of like a life.
