I've been sitting on this post for a bit.  I just wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be too, I don't know.  Something.  Creepy?  
  
The other night was Sean's birthday and about a million people's coming home parties.  All at the King's Head Pub (tavern? I am unsure). John pointed it out to me but I agree that it was really weird to be on the welcoming side of the Welcome Home party.  And at some point in the evening I was talking to someone and realized that almost every reason I'd want to be in Winnipeg was in one room.  There were a few notable exceptions (which I will refrain from noting and it won't mean you're not important) but on the whole, if a bomb had gone off there that night and I was the only survivor it would have been truly apocalyptic.  
  
My first phrasing of this idea was that almost all of Winnipeg showed up at that party.  The Winnipeg I care about and that is my home, I mean.  My home has a population of about forty people.  Everything else is just the rest of the world.  Which isn't to dismiss all that everything; I love being everywhere else.  But more than ever I can see why some people wouldn't ever leave, even though I still feel like a failure for coming back.  
  
Did I mention I got that job with the Winnipeg Public Library?  January 10th I start.
