An email I received today:


<blockquote>Dear Mr. Unrau:How could you be so incredibly unobservant as to NOT find Shangri-La?  I mean, we have only been putting up posters with arrows for four and a half centuries, and recently upgraded to flashing light arrows in the last decade.  We have tried very diligently to aid you in your search for our location; and thus, we have determined that you are a complete and utter dummy to have not found us.  We sincerely hope that if you do ever visit Tibet again, you bring your smart pants.

Sternly,

The Society of Shangri-La Orienteering Services and etc.</blockquote>


I've also been accused of having bad karma for stealing so many books which caused me to get sick.
