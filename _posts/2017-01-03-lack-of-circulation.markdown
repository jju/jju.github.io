It is cold here. 

I have not been cold like this in years. Not right now of course; right now I'm inside a well-insulated house which my girlfriend hates but I find has its charms. I wish I could unpack the books but that would be a step to homey for us right now, and besides the walls don't need the insulation. Not like we needed it in Nanaimo.

The cold, the constant cold inside the house out there wore me down. Here is different. I don't want to get into the dry vs wet cold thing, because that's not really how I feel it. The difference is more sharp vs pressing in my body. That goes for the recovery hotwater baths for my fingers as well. So cold, but recoverable.

The last time I lived in Winnipeg I whined and complained about the cold all the time. I'm sorry to all the people who had to deal with me. I must have been unbearable. This time I have to be the one who bears the cold, because it's my fault we came here. It would be bad form to do otherwise I think. Bad form, like I'm some posh fucker, no that's a misspeaking: it would just be bad for me to complain about the cold this time around.

So instead, I've been throwing myself into it. I read a book about winter cycling after I'd already started biking to work. It was a good book, because it wasn't just about what kind of bike to ride but what kind of city to build and what kind of person to be. And to winter-cycle in a place like Edmonton you need to embrace the winter. It can't be your enemy. I'm really trying not to make the entire world my enemy here, because I remember that turns out with me being miserable.

And yet I pass by the enemy every day. I prefer taking the Baseline Road route to work and back because that goes by the refineries. In the cold they're pumping out steam and smoke and it's hard not to think of the fires of mount doom. And I have this notion that living next to these things, that seeing them every day makes me better somehow, better than being off in a bubble of a perfect environment until it goes horribly wrong.

We watched The Two Towers the other night, and I do get frustrated with the simplifications in that movie most out of the trilogy. But I can see why the people of Gondor think what they do about the toughness of their situation, being right in Sauron's path. I feel a little bit more for Gondor, watching it in the path of winter.

My girlfriend doesn't agree. This is a stupid place to be and humans shouldn't be here. It's like the winter biking; what do you think you're proving by doing this?

And I'm not changing anything or doing anything important by being here, in the cold, riding a bike (some days). I suppose it is an ego thing, but not in the praise-seeking way I hope. I think it's more in the trying to do something to do this differently. To do something hard and not utterly fuck it up. To do something that might make some people miserable but lets me cope or even have fun.

I have been told I don't have fun like a normal person, that I don't behave like a normal person, that I'm all fucked up and should change everything about me. And I can't. But I can. But the only thing I'm changing right now is not complaining about the cold, about meeting it and flowing with it. And we'll see where we end up.
