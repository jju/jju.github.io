My Young Prophets article got written last week and I got confirmation that one of the editors has received it and found it not unsuitable for publication in the Canadian Mennonite.  We will see how long it takes for a cheque to show up at my door.  Also, I finished my [Machine of Death](http://machineofdeath.net/) story and can now endure the months of waiting to see if it will be selected for said august anthology.
