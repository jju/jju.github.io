Sorry that last post was so long.  I'm just done all my stuff now and have a week of classes left and am kind of pleased about it.  Since there isn't a DJS5 blogoff going on anymore I thought I'd post something cool but then I realized that all I've been doing is working on things, so I posted one of them.  I'll post the address to my (boring boring) website on energy conservation when it goes live.

I saw Kill Bill Vol. 1 the other day (as a reward for getting the website project done).  Nicey Nice.

A week from today is Do Nothing Day and a week from tomorrow Ludmilla and I start the drive back to Winnipeg.  It's been way too long since I've played UA, so I'm emailing people and getting games set up.  Fun fun!
