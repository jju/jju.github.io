Months ago I was asking a class about an article's "scattering like leaves" simile.  No one would say if they knew what it meant.  I wasn't sure if that was because leaves didn't fall here or they just didn't know what scattering meant or what.

Today I saw dried yellow leaves on the street downtown.  "Ah," I thought, "Leaves do scatter and fall here."  Then I spotted the workers and cursed that my camera was up in my apartment.

There were three guys with long (dare I say 10-foot?) poles hitting the branches with dried out leaves on them.  Whack! Whack!  And leaves would fall, evidently to be swept up later.  There were piles under each tree.  Little kids were frolicking and old people walked picturesquely in the autumnal showers.  Whack! Whack!

You can't trust leaves to fall on their own, you see.  Not if they're still around in December.  Whack!
