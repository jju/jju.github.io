At work yesterday I was destroying talking books. Which isn't something I'd expected my job to entail. You might think we're all about preservation of library material. But we aren't. These books are on a zero-use report which means they haven't been taken out since 2003. So, to make space for newer material we withdraw them from the library's collection. Normally withdrawn things end up in the booksale but talking books are special. 

See, Talking Books are different from regular audiobooks in that they're produced by the CNIB expressly for blind people (or people with a visual impairment). There are copyright restrictions on them that mean they can only be read (by which I mean "listened to") by people with visual impairment. So the CNIB won't let us sell them to anyone else. We can't even throw them out in a way that people might know they're audiobooks.

Which brings me to yesterday. My job was to take these withdrawn zero-use Talking Books, scribble on the case and pull the tape out of each cassette so listening to it would be impossible. Each book has 5-25 cassettes to it. It is not the most mentally stimulating task in the world, but it does get a little meditative. Reach poke pull wrap toss repeat. Then the destroyed cassettes go in a box which I seal and then throw out.

Harriet told me we have to hide the cases as we throw them out because we don't want the public to see that we discard library material. So I have to box up the cases as well. Which is ridiculous. If it's supposed to be a secret they shouldn't have me out at the desk merrily pulling tapes apart for the world to see. One guy stopped by and asked if I was fixing these tapes. "Nope! Destroying them," I said. "'Cause that's what your library is all about."
