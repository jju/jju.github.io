I haven't been blogging the last few days because I'm busy at work on projects.  Secret ones.  Shh.
  

  
Actually, one isn't too secret because it'll go public pretty soon.  I'm writing a regular column for [RPG.net](http://www.rpg.net).  It's geeky but it's about how to use real-life travel to make your roleplaying games better.  Not as a game designer, but as a player or GM.  Don't worry, I won't expect you to go read it.  But I will link to them when they are published.  Right now I'm building up a buffer so I don't have to madly dash them off moments before they are due.  (And no, this isn't a paying gig, but it's fun.)
  

  
Another (non-paying) project is scheduled to go live next month, but I haven't heard from the editor on that for a little while, so we'll see.
  

  
And the third is only a quarter done, so I can't talk about it at all.  We can't even mention the fourth one.
  

  
Plus I've got midterms to create and homework to mark and all that jazz.  Though I may hate teaching sometimes (especially Tuesdays) I love my fancy schedule.
  

  
I'm also starting to think about where to go this summer.  Up to the desert in Xinjiang?  See some of the Taoist mountains?  Be like Mao in Yenan?  So many possibilities, though I want to be cheap and save my jiao for the trip back next summer.
