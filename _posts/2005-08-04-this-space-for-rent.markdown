Self promotion time.  My [new column](http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/g2h203aug05.html) is up at RPG.net.  This one's on temples as living breathing pilgrimmage sites if I remember correctly.  Next month's will be about border crossings including some reflections on gazing into North Korea a couple of weeks ago.  
  
Also, I've received the new [House of Doc](http://www.houseofdoc.com) CD and will be able to seriously review it next week sometime.  If anyone from the Poor Choices would like me to update their webpage with any of their information they should really let me know.
