There was something important I wanted to share with all y'all.  What was it?  Je ne sais pas.  
  
Rachael's watching The Departed in the other room.  It just hit the "How fucked up are you?" cut to Sullivan shot exchange.  
  
Yankees Spring Training baseball was on Sportsnet this evening.  I drank a beer (thanks everyone who stocked my fridge on my birthday) and watched Hideki Matsui smack a very nice double.  I'm looking forward to the season beginning for reals.
