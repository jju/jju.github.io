First year students have to do their military training at school here.  They don't come to class for the first couple of weeks and (in Wanzhou at least) they get assigned tracksuits for learning to goosestep in.  All day you hear people shouting in unison.  I'll post some audio tomorrow.

So not only is the military training for freshmen going on right now, but there's a new policy saying that people aren't allowed to leave school buildings (with classrooms, not residences) until  10pm.  Even though all the evening classes go from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. All the students are supposed to stand around for half an hour waiting to leave the building.  Technically I guess they're supposed to study, but really.  
  

  
Needless to say, students don't like that, as I witnessed in the middle of a vaguely pissed off mob in the building where I was teaching tonight.  My students told me that it didn't apply to teachers but I didn't want to walk up in front of all these students to flaunt my power in front of a mob (and I wanted to see how it ended).  
  

  
There were occasional shouts from the students, but they were nothing compared to the guy who shouted at people who looked like they were trying to leave through the glass doors that were chained and padlocked.  I checked all the other doors to the building and they were all locked too.
