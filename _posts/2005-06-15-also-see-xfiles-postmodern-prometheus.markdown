The past few days I've been watching movies it's kind of weird I hadn't seen before.  Last night was Born on the Fourth of July.  This evening: Edward Scissorhands.
  

  
I knew the story primarily from the Animaniacs version Skullface Boneyhands, which is sort of odd I suppose, but as I remember it it told the story really well.  The real movie was a Fox production, but Animaniacs was Warner Brothers.  I wonder who paid who to do that, or if parody laws were their friends.
  

  
Anyway, it was a beautiful movie (even though my version was that film enthusiast's nemesis: fullscreen).
  

  
I'm reading The Scarlet Letter and the opening essay/autobiographical sketch, The Customs House, was eerily fitting for me in China.  In Hawthorne's motivations and realizations and (lack of) output in his time as a customs official.
