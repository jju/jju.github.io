One of my students told me I'd better call my mom because today's International Women's Day.  But instead of doing that I'll just wish all the women (and men who wish they could menstruate) I know a happy Women's Day.  
  
I'm busy naming freshmen this evening.  Most of them are women, which is annoying because I want to choose names for them that haven't been used by all my other students and that aren't too difficult (or that will get them funny looks down the line someday like Chewbacca might).  There will be a Leia though.  And a Daphne and a Velma.  I wish I could name some guys to get a break from all the Erics and Kings.
