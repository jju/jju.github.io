Yes, I hate it when people do this and accuse them of pulling students' language misuses out of Reader's Digest because they're far too perfectly cute.  But here were a couple of things from my American culture exams I just finished marking.

<blockquote>Bob Dylan: his voice isn't very great so he sings folk music.  
  
George Bush is the most famous civil rights leader.  
  
Hamshington Linken</blockquote>

These aren't ridiculous.  Well, except for the Lincoln one.  Especially when the right answer was Martin Luther King (with an optional Jr.).  
  
But I do think something went wrong in a class somewhere for the person who answered George Bush.  
  
And I loved that in their long answer questions about American music, tonnes of students talked about "A Boy Named Sue."  I did teach them something interesting.
