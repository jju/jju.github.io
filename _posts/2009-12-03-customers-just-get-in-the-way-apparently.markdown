In the last couple of days I've had a barrage of instruction at the library telling me not to help people. We have free WiFi provided by MTS. It gets fucked up all the time because the routers get jammed by big downloads or some such thing. The solution is to reset the router. At Intrepid this is a matter of going into the back and unplugging it and plugging it in again. Not so at the Falcon. We have to call IT to get them to do it. Except we got an email this week telling us we aren't supposed to call IT anymore, we're supposed to tell the patrons to call MTS. Which is bullshit. We know what needs to be done and MTS can't do it over the phone. Unless they had a technician actually at the library, there's nothing MTS can give the patron but frustration. 

Today was the first day we got to try out the new policy and it resulted in three angry letters to administration. Which is awesome. We encouraged the people to fill out the forms. Nothing happens at the library when the staff who actually have to deal with it make suggestions or get mad about stuff. It has to come from patrons.

I personally got in shit because I was bending the rules to be helpful in a different way. We have a grand total of one place in the Falcon where a person can listen to a library CD (apart from their own laptops). This DVD/CD player is understandably popular, so people have to book two hour blocks of time on it. They can only book the day of and they have to book in person. A few weeks ago a woman came in with her mentally disabled client (that seems to be the social-work lingo for person who is looked after by an underpaid well-meaning soul).  The client is very mentally challenged. She doesn't really use language, but screams a lot, in glee or anguish. Like a thirty-year-old sized two-year old. Her case worker must have a hell of a time.

Anyway, a few weeks ago this worker brought her client in and asked if they could listen to a CD. I explained how the station worked and told her it was booked up for the next few hours. The worker was pained and explained the difficulty in getting down to the library. Getting there for a time when they weren't guaranteed to get to listen to a CD would basically suck. So I wrote down our number and told her that if she called ahead and explained, we could sign her up ahead of time. So they wouldn't have to make a wasted trip to the library. This is against the rules which say the person must be there in person to sign up for the machine.

When I got into work today Harriet waggled a paper in my face asking if it was my writing. I studied it trying to figure out what it was from before I confirmed it was. She told me how this woman had come in saying I'd said she could phone in and sign up for the DVD player, but that's against the rules! I explained how the situation had come about. I pointed out how we break the rules for the Talking Terminal for one patron all the time by letting him sign up the day before. "But but but that's the talking terminal! That's completely different!" Which it is, insofar as they are different machines. 

Anyway, I explained why I did it. Harriet told me not to do that. I got to work. And then later she told me I wasn't allowed to step over the swinging door because that was a safety issue. I just about punched her in the face.
