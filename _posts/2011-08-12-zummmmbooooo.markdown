Last night through [the magic of YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEiFJF2aEiA) I learned about the Australian Holly will leave me for the moment she gets the chance. His name is Adriano Zumbo. Here are some facts about him:



	
  1. He's twenty nine and is a rockstar pastry chef/business owner here in Sydney.
	

  2. He makes [macarons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron)

	
  3. He's been on [MasterChef](http://www.masterchef.com.au/) a few times.

	
  4. [His website is kind of crappy](http://adrianozumbo.com/).


I'm currently devising ever-escalating in ridiculousness schemes to win Holly back from this attractive patissier. Even though technically I haven't lost her yet. But you watch a person watch a person fill meringues with pig blood and chocolate on the internet and you know how it's all going to turn out. It's all over but the bitter bitter weeping in [my sandwiches](http://threewordphrase.com/balogna.htm).
