![](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/1453931470_c3809e489e.jpg?v=0)Yesterday William Gibson gave a talk down at the library as part of the Winnipeg Writers' Festival.  I went and had a good time.  He signed my copy of Pattern Recognition which Dave sent me while I was in China.  So now it's inscribed to me from both of them, making it one of those "Things to save if the house burns down" of which I have a few.

Mr. Gibson ended up talking about the kinds of things he talks about in interviews. If you read the recent Washington Post interview (a link to which I cannot immediately locate) you'd get a good idea of what he said about the role of technology in shaping culture.  The theme was that he's not interested in the actual gizmos in the boxes from Future Shop, but in how they change people's behaviour.

One thing I found interesting was that he apparently doesn't read much about himself on the internet. I say this because someone brought up the opening line to Neuromancer being "The sky was the colour of a TV tuned to a dead channel" and asked how different Gibson thought it would be for a kid reading that today when the dead channels are that bright blue instead of snow.  I've read this thought loads of times over the past couple of years but he seemed genuinely never to have thought about it before (you could tell by his eyebrows). "An eleven year old reading Neuromancer for the first time and it's a world with a bright blue sky and no cell phones... Pretty different."

In all he was entertaining and thoughtful even with the person who went off on a rambling question far more about the questioner's erudition than anything significant (there's always one of these at something like this). And it was inspiring as all hell; during my shift I worked out a way out of my hole I'd gotten into on the novel, and spent the evening down at the Cavern (Brock Zeman and Dan Walsh were playing) scribbling it down in a notebook. Excellent way to spend $5.
