So I played violin/viola for a long time.  Learned a few pieces, made a few bucks, shed a few tears, you know how it goes.  Holly's been learning to play the erhu, a sort of two stringed Chinese violinish thing.  Friday she didn't have class and wanted to go have her lesson.  I was allowed to tag along.  In my decade of lessons I never had one like Holly's erhuing in Beihu park.  
  
We got up early cause Holly wanted to be there before 8:30, so she could warm up privately.  This didn't work at all, since her crew were there already.  Crew is a specifically chosen term here.  There was one woman who is her [de facto teacher](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663381/), but there were [two others](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663369/) who also kept on tagging in and out.  That came a bit later though.  
  
The erhu players have their own little section in the mornings at Beihu park.  The park is pretty big and is right in the middle of Nanchong.  It's got an artificial lake with little islands all connected by [picturesque bridges](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10668577/).  They aren't actually old, but have traditional stylistic details (plus fluorescent lights for nighttime).  The place where the erhu group gets together is on a little hill surrounded by trees.  There are two areas: one with a semicircular bench, and the other being a couple of small tables and benches.  
  
Well, while Holly was setting up we had quite a crowd, I assume because there were now two laowai instead of just one.  I was given fruit and told to sit right in the middle of everything at one of the tables.  They started playing songs and Holly was playing along, all in a kind of warmup.    
  
One man came over, and Holly told me that here was the [shifu](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663369/) (master) in this group.  He started playing a song and even knowing nothing about Chinese music you could just tell that he was great. Erhus have a little guard on the edge of the soundbox where the bow rubs against.  While Holly's (and some of the other players) little guards were relatively white and clean, the shifu's was worn almost completely through on both sides and the grooves were just coated in rosin.  
  
Then they pulled out the old folk songs and people were all [singing along](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663362/).  Now, I'm not a huge huge fan of Chinese folk music.  But I'm now thinking that it might just be that I'm not a fan of amplified Chinese folk music.  When it's outside it's really not as piercing as you'd expect.     
  
After a bit of singing songs with only a couple of erhus playing, Holly's teacher's daughter came to take pictures.  Lots of posed pictures with the erhu players and Holly (and me because I'm such an integral part of Nanchong's Chinese music scene) ensued.  
  
If you think this hasn't really sounded like much of a music lesson yet, well we think alike, you and I.  But then it was time to get down to it; [Holly's teacher](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10668570/) took her to the other area and began the lesson type stuff, while I stayed behind with the people who were out for a good time.    
  
A [man with a big plonkety instrument](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10668519/) (which I have now learned is called a sanxian) on his back wandered into the area.  Nobody immediately said "Norm!" or whatever the equivalent is when you're in a park with Chinese musicians, so I thought he might be there trying to sell stuff to the musicians.  His sanxian still had price tags on it, so it wasn't completely unreasonable.  But no, he settled in and started playing along with the erhus.  He was kind of like the bass player.  Really quiet and just focused on picking his notes and smoking his cigarettes.  
  
They were [playing songs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10668544/), and a couple of women were tentatively dancing.  After a while a [guy with a wooden flute](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663374/) showed up and the party really started.  He was one of those guys who you could tell loved being the centre of attention.  He'd sing for some songs, and play for others, but he was the one saying which songs they'd do next.    
  
Another [little guy who knew his dancing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10668554/) came along and started showing everybody up.  While the two women had a couple of songbooks with pink laminated covers they'd been looking things up in, this guy was dancing like he'd been doing it since he was a little kid (and constantly got the shit kicked out of him for being a dork).  Those lessons seem to stick.    
  
The piper guy kept on interrupting in one song because the women who were dancing kept on messing up the rhythm in one part of this one song.  After four or five go rounds (which required starting over from the beginning it seemed) they got it right and the piper could let it go on.  
  
Through all of this, more spectators would wander by and sit and watch for a while.  There were several teenagers/university student aged kids there with their grandparents.  There were [two old guys](http://photos5.flickr.com/10668537/) who were practicing outside this massive jam session near where Holly was getting her lesson.    
  
Her teachers kept on coming in and out of the jamming, but they [kept going back](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663379/) to help her.  Like really, these people were good and could have just ignored the beginner to have fun all by themselves, but Holly says that's not how this erhu group works.  From her second or third lesson she's been a part of (some might say embroiled in) the group.  They've gone to mountains to drink tea and eat and play erhu for whole afternoons.  They're quite an impressive bunch of people.  Holly's teacher gets her daughter to write things down in English between lessons, so she can explain stuff that didn't get through in Chinese, gestures and demonstration.  
  
We were there for two hours and it was the highlight of my trip to Nanchong (with playing catch in a kind of field coming in a very close second).  No one who'd come to one of my violin lessons would ever have said that.  
  
The most exciting thing I ever had was howling dogs.
