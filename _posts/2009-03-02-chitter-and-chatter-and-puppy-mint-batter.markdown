They're doing interviews for my position this week at Intrepid. Which means that before March is over I might be working at Section 22. Maybe. Who knows.

At Storytime this week the kids were really good, even though it was one of my weaker themes (all about different jobs). Esther the page is my helper since the parents aren't in on these storytimes, and she's really good. It was her interactions with the kids and their holding up fingers for the numbers that got me doing it in one story and everyone was way more excited when they could join in. And I learned that after last week's storytime (with my freshly shaven head) had prompted my most expressive listener to worry to her mom if my hair would ever grow back. At least I provoked a tiny bit of trauma.

Yesterday I did Children's Book Club because Targ is sick and her doctor told her to stay home. Normally no one shows up for Book Club, but of course since I was doing it and I hadn't read the book we had four kids. And to top it off, for this novel about war, the four kids were all ten year old girls who weren't really that into the story (nearer the end of our time I asked if they thought a group of ten year old boys would have liked the book better and they all said yes. "Boys like all that violent stuff.") But we went the whole hour and we had better chatting about it than I ever did with a group of four students in China, so score.

I made cookies the other day. That was fun. I bake so rarely. I don't know if I've ever made a cake not from a mix before. Hm.

Oh maybe I'll mention this. Our condo is having muy turmoil right now because no one wants to be the person to collect condo fees and pay the bills and such. The person who's supposed to be doing it is a douche and has said "Fuck all you guys. I hope they turn the water off. I'll return any cheques you send to me." Which isn't the least stressful thing you can hear from a person in that position. (Also not the most stressful.) So we're organizing a meeting and all this bullshit and it looks like I'll be taking a position of responsibility somewhere in there. Which sucks balls. I want to just pay my goddamned fees and not think about it, not be reminded that I am an owner of property. That if I want to leave the country for years upon end, I have a lot of shit to get handled first.

Along those lines, I think I've got my head wrapped around staying three more winters. That'd be over five years at the library in some form. And I'm saving money these days, so maybe when those three more winters are done I'd be funded enough to go places for a good amount of time. I don't know.
