This [Prince of Persia](http://www.amazon.ca/Prince-Persia-Graphic-Jordan-Mechner/) book is newly in our kids section at the library. I read it because, hey I like PoP, and the afterword by the original videogame creator talked about how this book wasn't an adaptation of the game but a story of another Prince, one who could co-exist with all the different versions of the Prince just like all the different tales of the Arabian Nights can coexist. The story was about prophecy and hiding and the structure of reality. And really seemed complex to go next to the [Owly](http://www.amazon.ca/Owly-Way-Home-Bittersweet-Summer/dp/1891830627/) books on the shelves. I told Drew how it should probably be in YA. We'll see if anything comes of it.
