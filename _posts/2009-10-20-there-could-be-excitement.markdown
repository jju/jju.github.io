Tonight at the library the Frontier Centre for Public Policy (a conservative-but-not-in-the-environmental-sense think tank kind of group) is screening a movie about how global warming people are fucking people up by scaremongering. It could get interesting. We were talking about it at the desk yesterday and wondering which library staff we should be sure not to tell if we didn't feel like dealing with pickets and heated discussion. I was also surprised to hear my coworkers be unconcerned about anthropogenic global warming, using phrases like "we only have a hundred years of records" and "volcanoes do more than we do" to discount it. I don't think I've ever heard those kinds of statements outside the internet before. Apparently I need to get out of my own little echo chamber.
