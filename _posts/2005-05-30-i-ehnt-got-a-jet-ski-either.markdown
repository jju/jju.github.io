I had lunch with a not-really-my-student-but-she-shows-up-to-my-classes-sometimes yesterday.  Her aunt and cousin (who she kept on calling her sister) live there.  The cousin is a biology student at our university and is writing her graduation paper on diabetes.
  

  
It was the least classy apartment I've been in in China.  They laughed about how they live like boys.  But I also hung out with Ning Hua in his dorm the other day and it was a lot bigger and nicer than I'd expected.  There are only four of them in their room which has ample cartwheeling space.
  

  
The point was that at this lunch we had to keep eating and eating and eating so I was still stuffed last night.  And now it's pouring rain outside which doesn't make me want to go get lunch even though I'm hungry now.
  

  
And I'm wearing black socks with shorts while listening to Weezer.  Cause I am just that classy.
  

  
In other news, there's a [Crisis on Infinite Butter Dimensions](http://www.wigu.com/overcompensating/) going on in Oklahoma.
