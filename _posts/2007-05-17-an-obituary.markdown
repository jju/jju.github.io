Here's my favourite reporting on the death of a dick (from [eatourbrains.com](http://eatourbrains.com/EoB/)):

<blockquote>Jerry Falwell died this afternoon.  I hope he went to where ever he needed to go.  In any case, I'm glad he's there now, and not here any more. It's best for all of us.</blockquote>

I thought it was classy in its brevity.  I mean, I've read a lot of celebration and "Fuck you!"s about it, but this was just kind of sweet.
