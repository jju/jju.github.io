Maybe it's wrong, but I found the following bit from [this news story](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=514&e=1&u=/ap/20041204/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/bush_cabinet) ridiculously funny: 

<blockquote>'For the life of me, I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do,' Thompson said as announced his departure.</blockquote>

Last night I was talking to one of the other teachers in our department (and found out he was one of Peter Hessler's students - that's the guy who wrote [River Town](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060953748?v=glance)) about how people are scared of terrorism in the US but not in China.  It was the perfect opportunity to make snide comments about the Bush administration's policy of fear, and one that I took.
  

  
Downtown Wanzhou was filled with uniforms last night but not in that menacing sense.  These were military uniforms on young friendly guys pulling suitcases with tanks embroidered onto them.  
  

  
Plus there was the most beautiful doorwoman I've ever seen.  She wore a long coat with gold buttons, white gloves and a hat that belonged in the French Foreign Legion (if they kept their clothes ridiculously crisp).  She was watching a kid run around a pole and looked like she'd been there for millennia.
