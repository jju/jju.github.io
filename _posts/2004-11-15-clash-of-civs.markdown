I had a very fine day of shutting off the entire world and playing Civilization III today.  Yes I'm a big geek who isn't making the most of his time in China.  Shut up.  
  
Well, Alex also came over tonight.  He was wearing a new $25 suit, that screamed "Mexican!" to me.  All pinstripy, but without a snappy hat.  The university job fairs are coming up so he got a new suit with the money he made trying to cheat for some guy on a professional advancement English test.    
  
Alex took the test for this guy so that the guy could get a promotion.  They arranged a fee of 400 RMB (about $50US), half before half after.  Of course Alex was caught so he only got his before money.  He didn't use his real name or job or school or anything on the self-criticism they made him write.  And the guy who he was taking the test for now can't take that test (and get that promotion) for two years.  
  
We talked about this on Thursday before he wrote the test.  I didn't encourage him, nor did I say that baby jesus would throw daggers at his eyeballs if he did it.  I wanted to hear how it turned out.  For you, the reader.  
  
Cause you don't want to hear about my Babylonian paratroopers.
