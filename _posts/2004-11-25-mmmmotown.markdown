I just read an old(ish) [interview with DJ Z-Trip](http://downhillbattle.org/interviews/ztrip.php) and followed some links to find an [amazing mp3 by said DJ](http://forums.djztrip.com/showthread.php?t=9362).  Read the interview (about why things like The Grey Album are important) and then [listen to something cool](http://www.punogre.com/ztrip/z-trip_-_motown_breakdown_part1.mp3).  
  
Also, the same issue of The Pengyou Press that my Djibouti thing was in reprinted (with slight changes) [my apology to all my teachers](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/2004/08/open-letter-to-every-teacher-i-ever.html).  One person has already written to say she agrees with the last line.
