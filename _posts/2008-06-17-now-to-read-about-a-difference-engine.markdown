At the library yesterday a young woman came up to me while I was shelving and asked if I'd be able to go get some Asians to be quiet. I think she only specified their race so I'd easily be able to see who to shush, but still. Happily, shushing people isn't my job so I could send her to the reference desk.

Tomorrow I've got another Reference/Reader's Advisory test in the morning. This one is for Children's and Young Adult positions. Good thing I spent the whole day searching Amazon's "Customers who liked this also bought..." listings for Rowling, Blyton and Westerfield books. I would love so much for Scott Westerfield to show up on this test. He's pretty new though, only the last few years, but his YA scifi stuff is supposed to be great.

Actually I didn't spend any time at all studying today. Good thing it's not an LSAT. Instead I finally rewrote a short story that's been bouncing around my computer in various formats for the last year and a bit. I got it down below 5000 words, resequenced the whole thing and actually made the point of it somewhat apparent with a non-anti-climactic ending. It's a hell of a lot better than any of the versions I've let people read before now. I have my eye on who I want to sell it to as well. I wanted to do this to get me back in the swing of rewriting before I start in on the novel again. I should be able to start that work on Thursday.
