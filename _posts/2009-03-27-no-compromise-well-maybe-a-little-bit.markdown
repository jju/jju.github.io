The first week at Special Services has gone okay. I haven't completely messed anything up yet (or at least it hasn't been brought to my attention if I have). Shelf reading is something I'm getting back into because Jimminy Christmas some of the CD sections are bad. I'm slogging through the Classical section now because it's arranged so stupidly it makes it nigh impossible to easily find anything (which affects the pages' ability to put things away in the right spot, let alone the regular public).

Last night I went to see Watchmen again, this time with Steve and Jen. There were a few things that were different about my experience. Watching it with people I was way more acutely aware of how Forrest Gumpish the soundtrack is. All that classic pop stuff does get a bit intrusive. And Hallelujah in the sex scene did make me giggle. And I'm formulating a theory of how the movie works to undermine one of the main meta themes of the book in regards to adolescence.  Because no one is as adult in the movie. They're all teenagers. There is no need for Baby Watchmen because the movie is them. It doesn't make the point that comics are for kids, but it does do something about superheroes being something to grow out of. The whole movie is a coming of age story. Starring pathetic aging adults.

Man, I cannot wait for Hassie to get back and a good Camby night discussion. It was great seeing Steve too. I mean it had been months, and I don't know why. Oh wait, it's because I hate going outside in the fucking winter. Yes. I did bring it all back to the stupid fucking weather. Go me.
