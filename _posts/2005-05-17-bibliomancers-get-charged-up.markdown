About the [Newsweek](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7857154/site/newsweek/) thing (where a poorly fact-checked article about the Quran being flushed down a toilet in Guantanamo caused riots that killed a bunch of people in Jalalabad), [Irshad Manji](http://www.muslim-refusenik.com/), my favourite progressive lesbian Muslim, has a good little [reality check](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/irshad-manji/the-riots-in-jalalabad_1013.html).  These people were rioting because a book was (not actually) mistreated.  Not because of a person, but a book.
