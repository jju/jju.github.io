Never have I felt more like I was being sized up as a future in-law as at the dinner I went to tonight.  Like, not even with the families of girls whose name I know.  
  
[Shi Wei Wei](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/2103785/) (no idea on the spelling) is a first year student that I don't teach.  But I've talked to her at English corners and things.  Her English name is Vivien but I teach at least three Viviens and a couple of Vivis so it didn't help.  Of course, I can never remember anyone's name from English corner anyway so when she called she could have been practically anyone.     
  
She invited me to her home last weekend but I couldn't go.  She called again yesterday to see if I could come today.  I still didn't have a face to put with the name of this girl that was phoning to invite me over for dinner but I said yes.  She and two of her uncles showed up at the school gate and happily I recognized her.    
  
This week was her little sister's 16th birthday and there were piles of aunts and uncles and [cousins](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/2103784/) over for this big meal with the foreigner.  "This will be her best birthday ever!" they said.  Because a skinny white guy was there.  Woo!  
  
The family is well off and there were a few comments about how good it is for Chinese people to go abroad.  It feels like my mom is going to get a call this week to check on her respectability.  It was all kind of bizarre.  
  
For the record, I'm not planning on joining her family.  Nice as they all are.
