I haven't heard anything about the Section 22 job so I'm assuming the senior person took it. I'm probably getting a letter delivered to Alison's house informing me of that fact. Selah. Hopefully the next one will be offered up soon.

Saturday was my Halloween program down at Intrepid. Now, I had low expectations for this thing. I had stories and a craft, and Targ had a hot potato kind of game she wanted me to play with a plush pumpkin. This is for 6-12 year olds. We only had 10 kids signed up, and past experience told us that we'd definitely not get that many show up on the day. I was in costume as an "old timey newsman" (wearing the exact same thing I wore to Reyn's wedding plus an old camera). So I was ready.

Maybe half an hour before it was set to start, Vina asked if I was excited for this, my first program. "Not really," I replied. "It's just something I've got to get through. It'll all be over soon." It felt a lot like a midterm or something. I'd studied but wasn't planning to knock it out of the park or anything.

One really good thing about the day was that Targ called in sick. She would have been in there with me, which would have added to my stress. She would have second guessed everything and I would have felt like I was being evaluated. This way I could ignore her game because I hate circle games and the like and just focus on the stories, which I think I've established I'm good at reading.

When the time came to begin I had four neighbourhood kids who'd shown up a little earlier that afternoon and signed up. Now, they signed up without their parents, and they did it basically because they were bored and hanging out anyway. Technically I wasn't supposed to let them register. And in the end, they were just bored and disruptive through the stories, drinking slurpees and changing costumes and stuff so we didn't start or end anything close to on time. We had an LSA3 from  in for the afternoon and she came in to be the extra staff for it, and she told me not to be discouraged, that not every program will be dominated by the problem kids. 

But the whole "having your parents register you" was clearly an attempt to keep these kids out of the Halloween program. Their parents could not give a shit. And limiting the stories to just the well-brought-up middle class kids of the area seems really kind of shitty. In any case, if I hadn't let these "problem kids" in, there would have been a grand total of two (unrelated) children and a mother. Those two kids and the mom were the ones who enjoyed the stories I read them. We discussed costumes and stuff, they were all over the craft, making little papercraft vampires and frankensteinian monsters. It would have been fun with those two kids, but I spent most of my time managing the rest of them who weren't being bad exactly, just bored. I deal with those kids better when I'm not trying to get them to do anything.

But we got through it and no one had to phone the police. Like last year.

Oh, there was another kid, probably 12 or so and the biggest girl in her class, who Ivy thought was going to stab me and rip out my heart. See, people aren't supposed to have food and drinks at the computers. I don't pay a tonne of attention to it, but do get people, especially kids, to put their drinks somewhere else if I notice them. This girl had a 2L bottle of coke at the express terminal, which she always uses and we always have to kick her off of when people are waiting. She uses it because it's the one that doesn't require a library card. At one point after Vina had told her she wasn't supposed to have drinks open at the computer, the station was unattended with an open, half-full 2L Coke bottle sitting next to the monitor. 

I sighed, grabbed the bottle and the cap to close it up and was walking back to the desk when the girl stopped me and grabbed her Coke back scowling at me. I explained to her that we don't want open drinks by the computers and I was just closing it up. And she stared at me. "I wasn't stealing it." Stare. "Just moving it out of the way." Stare like she has no idea what this gibberish coming from my mouth could possibly signify. "If you close it up you can put it on the floor." Stare. Vina came to back me up, reminding her about how she'd warned her. Blank stare. Mercifully, someone who could articulate thoughts (actually one of my favourite patrons) showed up needing help at the Miniserv side of the desk so I helped her find poems about seasons. Later I asked Vina if the Coke girl had ever made any indication that language was something she was familiar with. I mean, I know she speaks. I'd been talking with her earlier in the afternoon. Vina thinks she wasn't talking because she was trying to get a handle on her emotions in a way that didn't involve murdering me right there. So that was nice.
