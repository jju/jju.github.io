 [McD's Opening](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/9553673/)

So it's happened.  The big opening was today and I was kind of disappointed.    
  
I mean there were crowds watching the screaming mic'ed people parade people holding sundae signs, and there was a big line to get in, and lots of security guards, but it wasn't crazy silly.  I took a bunch of pictures but haven't uploaded any more because if I do it pushes some of my older flickr pics beyond the pale and they're ones I've got an editor looking at for an online magazine.  So yeah.  
  
The line didn't go down the block.  It was filled with upper middle class families with their kids.  There really wasn't a lot to laugh at.  I guess the red hats that lots of kids got were kind of funny, but meh.    
  
No one seemed to be clawing people's eyes out to get a Big Mac or anything.  Maybe I just didn't hang around long enough, but I had a couple of students with me (for protection in case an anti-Japanese riot broke out).  
  
And now I'm going to have to hear godawful "I'm lovin' it" jingles whenever I walk down that street.  I don't know if the sundaes'll be worth it.
