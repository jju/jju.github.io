The hidden forces behind my life have conspired to deprive me of sleep.  Who wakes up at 4 for no reason?  Stupid people.  So I spent my morning reading Salman Rushdie essays.  I'm impressed with his condemnation of antiamericanism without seeming like his ass is loaded with republican cocks.  And he talks convincingly about not blaming victims.
