I had a houseguest last night.  Aesion wasn't allowed into his dorm so he called asking if he could stay the night.  I may have mentioned this before but I have no couch.  And no vaguely comfortable furniture.  And only one blanket.  I am not equipped for overnight guests.  
  
So Aesion spent the night on my two wooden armchairs with cardboard boxes to support him over the gap between them with my travelling sheetsack and the fleece cloak thing my aunt sent me.  
  
I'm sure his back was horribly screwed up and awful, but he'd spent the night before at an internet bar where he had to remain awake, so I guess it may have been a step up from that.  
  
And today he took me out for a duck dinner to thank me.
