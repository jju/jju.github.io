Today I finish up my last bit of work for my MLIS degree (my professional experience moderating TeenRC.ca) and a couple of hours ago I got a phone call offering me a job as a librarian in Campbell River BC, out on Vancouver Island. It's been a good day.

So Campbell River is a small town on the eastern side of the island. The branch there is a hub for five surrounding very small libraries whose collections we also manage. My job is as a Children's/Youth librarian and they really want to develop their teen programming and services so I'm being given an almost blank slate to be working with. They already have a Teen Advisory Council set up, and my boss is really proud of the teens up there. So it should be a good time.

The branch is small and I'll get on-desk time covering both Adult and Children's services, which is great. I know that another library in the library system does D&D nights so there's precedent for me to get some gaming into this library if the members are into that.

I've never lived in a small town before so we'll see how that part of everything works, but it'll be somewhere new and hopefully means I'll have more to write about. It's going to be so nice to unsubscribe from all my jobfeeds.

Thank you everyone who's been nice to me while I've been kind of down this summer. I've complained a lot about the soul-grinding nature of jobhunting, but I have been lucky enough to get interviews, and now I'm going into full-time work. Which is weird. My plan is to save money for doing the Trans-Siberian trip in the next couple of years since I'll be making money and won't be in a big city to spend it.

A week from today I'm going to go to Winnipeg for a week. It's been a year and a half since I was there for my grandma's funeral. I planned this a while ago as a break from the accursed hunt, but now it'll be much more fun without my lack of income to pay October's rent looming.

I'll also try to write more now that I'm no longer wasting all my energy on cover-letters.
