So, strangely enough, while reruns of Olympic pingpong are still all over the tube, I have to turn to the internet to find out what's up at the [World Cup of Hockey](http://www.wch2004.com).  I knew that the Canadians and Americans had traded home and home preliminary wins and I knew that they would open the tournament playing against each other in Montreal.  I didn't know about the special vintage jerseys.  So when I saw a picture on [cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca) I didn't recognize the yellow (I mean gold) that Brodeur was wearing.  But I noticed the score, 2-1.  Woo Canada!
  

  
The jerseys were part of [the story](http://www.wch04.com/scores/recaps/103_6_recap.html) of the game.  The [1920 Winnipeg Falcons](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympians/falcons.shtml) won the first hockey gold for Canada.  And they didn't have their names on the backs, just Canada.  And they were wearing replicas of those vintage jerseys for one game only.  How could I not love it, being in China?  It's hockey, it's Winnipeg, it's gold medal excellence, it's beating the Americans, all at a time when CBAs are threatening the NHL season.
  

  
So long story short, I'm getting one of these jerseys for Christmas.  Hooray for kickass mothers (who actually read their son's blogs)!  I don't know if I'll get it sent here or just have it waiting for me to return in 2006.  2006?  I'll have to have my jersey here for those Olympics in Italy.  Well that clinched it.  It too will have Canada in place of a name.  And anyone who knows me knows what the number will be.
