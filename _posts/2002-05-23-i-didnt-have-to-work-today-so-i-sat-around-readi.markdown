I didn't have to work today, so I sat around reading.  Kudos to Sarah for recommending Immortality.  Oh and I'm slowly inventorying the books so I know what's been appropriated while Ren and I are gone.  I've gotten through my main gaming shelf and a chunk of my trade paperback comic collection.  And I reorganized my bookshelves so my rickety white one has all the trade paperbacks while the sturdy white one is triple layered with pocketbooks.  Yep, this Justin character sure knows how to have a good time.
