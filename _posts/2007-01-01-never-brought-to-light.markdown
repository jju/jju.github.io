Hi there twenty aught sev.  I wonder if you will impress yourself upon my consciousness.  I only bring this up because in my head if I'm thinking of when something recent happened, I always assume it's 2004.  Now it's obvious why that would be, since 2004 was when I left the uncleland, but I wonder if that'll be a permanent thing, that everything I ever think of will be based on a pre/post-2004 calendar.
