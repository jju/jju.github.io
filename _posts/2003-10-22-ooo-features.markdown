And not just the radio kind (which is sort of going well now).  I hadn't poked around to see what Blogger was letting us do for a while and now I find I can have titles to my posts!  Now my favourite part of email (cryptic subject lines, though this one isn't so much) can translate into the blogging world.  Wunderbar!
  

  
Thing I didn't realize #70032: How many emails I'd get about shaving off the goat.
  
Thing I didn't realize #70033: How they would be unanimously positive.
  

  
But now I must leave this apartment and collect sound.
