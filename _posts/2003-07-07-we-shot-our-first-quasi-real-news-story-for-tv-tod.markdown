We shot our first quasi-real news story for TV today.  I was the camera operator and things went fairly smoothly.  I didn't fuck anything up.  The colours were all good.  We got some decent shots of diving and coaches doing cool stuff.  And we got it fast.  Tomorrow is the story that I'm producer on and I really hope that I don't get mad at my camera and sound people.  It's a money I might have to eat kind of situation, so I want to make it excellent but I don't want to be mister auteur asshole.  I mean, it's just a 60 second news story.
