Have I ever mentioned how much I hate teaching this goddamned reading course?  I'm working on making two midterms for it right now and my loathing is reaching Cairo Sheraton proportions (if you were Reyn, when you read that you would have said "Yikes!" I assume that most of you are not Reyn, hence the digression).
  

  
I just want to drop the pretense that I can actually teach them anything about reading that's useful to their level of English (especially since they're all over the map that way).  I could get them to read things and ask them, did you undertsnad this? and then explain it when they didn't, but how do I teach how to understand something?  I'm almost at the point of stealing things from the net and asking "So what's that about eh?" and being done with it.  It's not like anything I do in class is at all useful.  I hate this pretending to teach.
  

  
In the culture class I at least have the illusion that I have something useful to tell them that they might not know.  Content is teachable, but this isn't a content course it's process.  I just have no idea how to teach a process that has been completely natural to me for decades.  And how to test it?  Fuck if I know.
  

  
But when Steveo said the last time I went off on a teaching rant is useful for perspective.  I have to be wary of developing a teacher complex.  I am not a teacher.  This is not my life's work or anything.  This is my day-job.  Holly compared it to a situation Joey faced in a Friends episode (which was a good comparison so despite my general anti-Friends snobbishness it didn't negatively affect our friendship).  If this gets added to the list of "Stuff I'm not good at" (which includes: talking on the telephone, fiddling, and not rolling my eyes in church) that's not the end of the world.
  

  
So yeah, I should just relax.  It's not like this affects these kids' futures or anything.
