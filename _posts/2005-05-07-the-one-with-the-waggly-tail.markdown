I spent some time this afternoon trying to put together a post about my new new shirt, but it kept on degenerating into crap that'd make you all laugh at how I'm off in China "trying to find myself."  So long story short: I bought a black Tshirt yesterday.  Speculation on why that would cause existential crises can now begin, unfuelled by me.
  

  
On my way back from the store I passed the most pitiful dog I've ever seen (and I've been in India).  It was a mongrel kind of thing, bigger than most of the pugs and stuff you see in China.  It had no fur except for a thin stripe down its back.  It's skin was black with lots of pink sores.  Above its shoulderblades was a pussy collection of nodules.  Its ears stuck out sideways and then drooped, like its broken tail.  It was sitting in the middle of the street facing away from traffic, not caring at all that cars were swerving around it.
  

  
There's no picture of this dog for the same reason that I don't take pictures of the goiter-faced beggar in front of the big China Mobile centre, or the crippled guys who wail while dragging themselves along on their faces.  I don't want to try and capture someone else's sadness like that.  I've been brought up not to stop and look at accidents or other shittiness (reason 837 I'm not so hot as a journalist - not that I'm condemning any of you who are, cause I do know that's not what it's all about).
  

  
I watched the dog for about ten minutes.  It got up once and moved a few feet further into the middle of the intersection.  A guy asked if there was anything he could help me with.  I said there wasn't and walked home.
