It's cold and spraying out rain.  I don't like it.  My hands were drawn right up into my sleeves for my walk home from work.  If it's like this again tomorrow I might have to wear mitts.  What the hell am I doing living in Canada?  I should be somewhere I don't have to worry about regaining body heat after walking home before summer even officially ends.
