Today was another ridiculously blue-skied day.  What the hell is going on?  It's like it's taunting me.  I keep on thinking that this is the last blue sky I'll see all year, and then three days later it comes back.  Damned skies that think they're the freakin' Messiah.
  

  
I'm not doing anything special these days.  We got a bagload of books from Myrrl (our boss back in the States) to take to our schools for their CEE libraries.  Supposedly in Wanzhou we already have all the Narnia books, which I might read again in the hopes that all those allegories won't piss me off.  I've stashed a collection of Hemingway stories and The Great Gatsby (because any friend of Gatsby is a friend of mine - bonus points to anyone who posts the source for that quote in the comments).  
  

  


<blockquote>"What's the world's greatest lie?" the boy asked, completely surprised.
  

  
"It's this: that at a certain point in our lives we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate."</blockquote>


  
And I read Paulo Coehlo's book The Alchemist (see above quote).  When Reyn and I were travelling in India I saw this book everywhere.  Everywhere.  So I saw it in the stack of books and had to read it.  I wasn't very far in when I felt like I'd read it before.  When Melchizedek told Santiago the story of the drops of oil and the palace I remembered that James read this book to us in grade nine.  Or maybe not the whole book, because I couldn't remember anything else about it.  I'd always thought that story was in Jacob the Baker, but evidently I'm wrong.  Anyway, I love reading books whose effects on me I can trace (if I can say that without sounding like an ass of pomposity).
