Via[ Boingboing](http://boingboing.net):  Are you looking for Halloween music?  Try this freaky happy version of [The Raven](http://www.maxmomirror.com/mirror/ghouls/gwa_disc1_17_buddy-morrow-and-his-orchestra_the-raven.mp3) (MP3).  They have a [two CD Halloween set](http://www.oddiooverplay.com/ears/hallowseve/) at Oddiooverplay.com.  Very camp.  Not at all scary, but the Winchell's Donut ad is freaky.  
  
Listening to: **Satan Takes a Holiday** from the album Ghouls With Attitude - Disc 1
