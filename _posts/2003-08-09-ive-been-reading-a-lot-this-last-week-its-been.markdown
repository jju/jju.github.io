I've been reading a lot this last week.  It's been really good.  For some reason I hadn't been reading as much as usual for a while there.  But now I'm back.  I got the H2G2 radio scripts and they are too funky.  It's really neat to see where the five part trilogy came from.  Reading is good.  Selah.

Wednesday was a very odd evening.  I swear I was on the phone for three hours.  I never talk on the phone.  I hate the phone.  But people kept calling.  They were people I was happy to talk to, but I was wiped out after all that.  I pace when I'm in the telephoning process so combined with all the mental effort I have to go through to keep up a conversation (where there are no visual cues that I'm listening even if I'm not saying anything) I've got a whole physical thing going too.  I'm not complaining, but it was a bit much.  All you people who have nothing to do with each other should really get organized and space these things out for my benefit.

I finished off all the radio stuff that I'll be marked on, so all that's left is the paper.  Which I'll finish tomorrow.
