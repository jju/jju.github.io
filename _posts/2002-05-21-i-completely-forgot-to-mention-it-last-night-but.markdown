I completely forgot to mention it last night, but Dave and I saw Attack of the Clones yesterday.  We were wondering if episodes 4-6 were that cheesy when they first came out.  I mean, it's hard for me to be objective because those ones have embedded themselves so much in my head, whereas these new ones aren't, but they really seem a lot cheesier.  I mean you have the "I've got a bad feeling about this" and there are lines and situations that are supposed to be funny, but they don't seem as forced as what eps 1 and 2 have had.  Maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon.  But Yoda.  That made it worth the price of admission.  And the two (count 'em two) Samuel L. Jackson badass Jedi shots as he's breaking up Dooku's party.  And two classy badass Jedi lines.  Very pleased about those.  I think that aside from Padme's flailing about in horridly bad screaming when her back was slashed the gladiatorial style execution thing was the kind of cheesiness that Eps 4-6 had, and I liked it.  And I spotted the NSync guys.  They were the ones who tossed lightsabres and a blaster to Anakin Padme and Obiwan when the Jedi assault gets underway.
  
XFiles is now over, and it ended well in my opinion.  It was the only episode I watched this season, but Mulder was back and on trial for his life.  It was a good recap and it seems that CSM died after getting hit by a missile, but that's the third time he's died and there'll still be movies yet to come, so I'm not holding my breath.
