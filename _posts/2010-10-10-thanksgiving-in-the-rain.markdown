We had a potluck thanksgiving here yesterday. Nine people and two pies. I made portobello mushrooms as a turkey alternative. People brought wine. Marlis made amazing cranberry sauce. It was pretty fun. One of the people who was here was a camera assistant on Watchmen and had nothing but good things to say about working with Zack Snyder. I missed having a baseball game on TV before and after the meal but watching the Yankees sweep the Twins again might have been too sad for me.
