Well here I am in Wanzhou.  The [college](http://www.sanxiau.net) that I'm teaching at is small and on the side of a "mountain."  The quotes are on that for everyone who thinks that the Rockies mark the minimum size for mountainness.  The Yangtze river is across the street (which takes a bit of walking to get to) and it's all pretty good.

Today I'm going out to buy some supplies to give my kitchen and bathroom a good cleaning.  They said I couldn't move in when I got here yesterday because they were busy cleaning, but it sure as hell wasn't either of those rooms.

I also found out that rather than lazing about getting used to the place for a few weeks, I start teaching Newspapers and Magazines on Monday.  I'll also be teaching some murkily understood British survey course.  I don't know if it's culture or literature or what.  Hopefully I'll find out soon.

*Update* It's a course on British history, geography, the whole shebang (next term I do the same thing for the States).  You know, all that stuff you **don't** learn in Canadian high school.  But it seems like I will be able to toss in some Douglas Adams and the Beatles, so I'm happy.
