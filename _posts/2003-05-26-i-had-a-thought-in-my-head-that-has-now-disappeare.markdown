I had a thought in my head that has now disappeared. I will type a k every 10 seconds until I remember what it was. k k Field Day in New York!  Beastie Boys, Radiohead, Beck!  On June 7th and 8th!  I suppose it would be the height of assholery to ditch Sean and Ren who're coming out to London expressly to see me for a festival that would be stupidly amazing, eh?  Unless Sean wants to bring the X down to Long Island?  Tickets are still available.  Only $190US including camping!
