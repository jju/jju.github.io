I don't have much to say about it, just that he's the only Pope I knew and sort of hope the next one isn't a little old white guy.  Whatever.  My connection to the Pope, of course, lies solely in my DNTO piece exploring who would win in a pop-cultural battle between him and Batman.  Sadly, it isn't available in the CBC archives.
  

  
Anyway, here's an interesting bit about choosing the next one.

<blockquote>As for the famous smoke signal - black if the balloting is unsuccessful, white if a new pope has been elected - no papal constitution codifies the practice. While the first written record of ballot burning, which will take place twice a day in the latest conclave, dates back to 1417, Baumgartner found no mention of smoke signaling an unsuccessful ballot until the 19th century. After several 20th century elections in which white smoke appeared and then turned black, chemical additives were introduced in 1963 to clearly differentiate between the two.

The more you know.
  

  
Of course, [other people](http://www.warrenellis.com/index.php?p=550) have their own thoughts on the event.
