My internet here today has been really intermittent. Not time-wise, but site-wise. Some sites I can get to; some remind me of China. I blame the cold. The cold is also hampering the rest of my productivity, hence the lack of interesting posting going on. I do encourage you to read my [vagabondscrawl](http://vagabondscrawl.tumblr.com/) site (or [its feed](http://vagabondscrawl.tumblr.com/rss)), which has links to things I'm reading at least. My numb little fingers don't need to work as hard to share stuff as they do to type intelligibly.

But I learned that two of my friends are going back to Nanchong this month. Holly I knew about, but Phil too! This extra incentive means sometime this year I'll probably end up out there for a visit. Especially since Sean and I didn't manage to see Phil on our trip to Amerrica this fall. Maybe I'd be able to take the train up to Tibet this time around...

Had a good chat with Holly today. She's off visiting people in various non-Virginian states, and she said something I understood so much I'm reproducing it here without her consent: "I could feel myself snap into pay-attention mode as soon as we got on the road out of Harrisonburg." I do so love that feeling, how it happens and you stop foggy living and go into the real stuff.

On a good day I can hit that without going somewhere new. I wrote a story at 3am the other day moments after snapping out of a dream, and I had that feeling. There's a wall I used to bike past in September and October that at a certain time of day reflected so much warmth at me it always felt like a new thing. Last night walking home from work in the cold a dog got mad at me walking and barked and barked all mad from its confined backyard and I got all those primal goosebumps of fear. There are those moments, but man pay-attention mode is a lot easier to do when you're somewhere else. And all your calories aren't going directly into staying warm.
