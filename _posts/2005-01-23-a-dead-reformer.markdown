I'd heard Zhao Ziyang's name before but it took a Canadian being [the first foreign dignitary](http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/01/21/kenney050121.html) to visit his home to make me realize he'd died and [what he'd meant](http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3574378).  
  
I'll be honest.  I was 9 when the Tiananmen Square massacre happened and only remember it being something big.  That kind of vague notion you have when you're young that stuff is happening that doesn't directly affect you but it should.  Or you might have that feeling now.  I do.  
  
Anyway, Zhao Ziyang was the leader of the CPC who went to the square to warn the students to go home, he couldn't stop what was going to happen.  You can kind of give him a Pilate sort of image if that appeals to you.  He didn't necessarily do it for altruistic reasons (it was a political gamble that could have had huge benefits), but he was a reformer, which is important in this country.  He was kicked from his position and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life because he went to those students.  He didn't apologize.  
  
I think the thing that bothers me the most about this is the idea that China's development since 1989 is proof that DXP [did the right thing](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/19/content_410244.htm) by shooting those demonstrators.  
  
I mean, it happened and it can't unhappen, but the idea that it was necessary since the economy looks good now uglifies the whole thing even more.  If China's going to be proud of its economic progress it should at least have the decency to say that the country is succeeding _despite_ killing its own civilians instead of _because_ of it.  
  
I mean, that's the kind of thing I expect from Bushites.
