So that was 2004.  See ya Bobo.  It's time for a Cock.  (I know that technically we've still got a month till the Chinese years switch over.  Meh.)  
  
For me 2004 was my China year.  The idea really started taking root last January after I realized I wasn't getting a scholarship to be a CBC star.  I didn't want to start out at some little paper and didn't want to fail again at trying to get a CBC job, so why not sell my soul to MCC?  I'd often threatened my mom with doing just that.  It was the reason I'd been baptized after all.  Well I won't say what I ended up doing, but I did end up in China.  
  
I wanted to say more in this post but I have to leave now to go hang out with foreigners.  It's New Year's Eve.
