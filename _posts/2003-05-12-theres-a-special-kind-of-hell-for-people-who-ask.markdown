There's a special kind of hell for people who ask questions like this but when is this course going to get busy?  Today's classes consisted of discussing Jayson Blair being a pathological liar and then doing a five minute assignment in the lab and emailing it in.  Then we're told that most of our print assignments will have a 4pm due date that day, which might make for a rough couple of hours, but that means no homework.  I wish they'd just get on with it already.  They keep on telling us it'll be intensive but fuck; cut the foreplay.
