This apartment and I are spending one last night together.  It won't be pretty, but none of our time together has been that close to beautiful.  People've looked at us and said "At least my apartment and I have a healthier relationship than that."  There've been spiders, uncomfortable chairs and awkward makeshift dinner parties.  Cockroaches, scalding showers and odd smells.  Now is where I say "but I'll miss it anyway" which would be a lie.
  

  
I lived in my previous apartment (the one that will be my apartment benchmark for all time) for a year as well.  This new one will be mine for almost a year (a school year at least).  I wonder if I'd like them more if I was spending more than one year in them apiece, or if all their faults would be that much more evident and hard to overlook (and redundant!).
  

  
It's very hard to think about living in one place for a long period of time.  Or doing the same thing.  I'm glad I don't have to yet.
  

  
But back to the breakup at hand.  It's time for me to leave.  This relationship wasn't working out.  I knew it wouldn't from the beginning but tried to put a good face on it.  Selah.
  

  
While I'm moving tomorrow and for a few days following my Internet may not be connected.  Please bear with the absence.  I suggest reading random Daily Dinosaur Comics after starting with [this one](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=609) which is all about teaching without sounding like a jerk.
