Have I mentioned how much I'm looking forward to getting out of fakeLondon this weekend?  Muchly.  There's way too much work to do here.  That'll all get nicely forgotten Friday afternoon.  And then I will freak out massively on Monday.
  

  
Our NewMedia project is due next Thursday.  My chunk of it is primarily dealing with Earthships.  Dave would be so proud (if the bastard would actually check his email and reply to anything I sent him in the last month; it's not like he's got anything more important to be thinking about).  But don't worry, I'll pin him down this weekend and get a quote that I can use so it looks like I interviewed more than one chap.
  

  
And I've resigned myself to my non-impending CBCishness.  Happily, a few people at school have also been surprised that I wasn't one of the five that was selected, so it's not just me being egotistical.  Bright sides include: I do get to work at DNTO for a month.  And now I can worry my mom by saying that I'll be an independent documentary maker instead of looking for a real job.  If anybody has any need for a documentary to be made (preferably on DV) let me know. (Stupid House of Doc recording their next album in Winnipeg instead of fakeLondon so I can't do my ten minute doc on that)
