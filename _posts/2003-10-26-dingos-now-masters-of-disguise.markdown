I never want to live in a world where stuff like [THIS](http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-12863870,00.html) can't happen:

"A one-year-old boy has been bitten 30 times by a group of more than a dozen other babies at a nursery in Croatia."

Really.  If humanity ever gets so predictable that packs of babies have no chance of turning on eachother in an orgy of toothery  I don't want to see it.
