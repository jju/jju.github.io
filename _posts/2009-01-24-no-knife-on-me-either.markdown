This is the kind of thing that makes me change the route I'm walking home: 

<blockquote>"I'm going home to get a knife, you piece of shit!"</blockquote>

Two guys (plus assorted hangers on) were having a big ol' yelling match in the Maryland Hotel parking lot tonight as I was walking from Notre Dame down the very short block to my apartment. Instead of walking through that parking lot (as is my wont) I walked down the street next to McGee in the middle where the lights are bright and I'd be sure to notice anything spilling out of that fight in my direction. I walked with a purpose and didn't try staring anyone down and didn't look too interested in anything. Went around the block and came to my building from the front, where no one was around belligerating and made it in fine. This was the first time I've had to take any sort of precautions since moving here, but see mom? I'm very conscious of where I live and am safe about it.

I was coming home from the Section 22 Xmas party which was a nice dinner at the restaurant in the Radisson. Place was empty, but kind of felt like that hotel bar from Lost in Translation, being all up on the 12th floor with a view of the city. We griped about 311 and talked about horses. Good times. I received a box in the re-gift exchange.

Yesterday I signed up two of my favourite kids for Storytime. Their mom was in and did her best flattery job, all telling me how much they pestered her about when they got to go see Justin again. She told me they'd be so upset she came down to the library without them. And then she forgot their birthdays and made me promise I wouldn't tell anyone. Ha! I refrained from mentioning I might not be there for the entire run of Storytime, since it appears I will never be released to go downtown.

Also yesterday I completely failed in my bid to tell Targ to do her own goddamn job and not have me do it. I am just no good with confrontation. All I managed was getting an acknowledgement from her that picking her rhymes for her Baby Rhyme Time program isn't my highest priority. Vina said it sounded like I was going to throw up or something as I got myself all unable to speak. It's funny how much better I talk when I'm not saying anything meaningful. 

I'm now finding loads of other "higher priority" things to do so I won't be doing Targ's job for her. Lots of cutting things out for felt stories. They're pretty fun and it's nice to make things, even simple things, look nice.
