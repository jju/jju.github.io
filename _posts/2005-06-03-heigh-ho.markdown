My new [Gamer's Guide to Hitch Hiking](http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/g2h202jun05.html) column is up at RPG.net.  This time I'm talking about underground cities.
  

  
Sadly, when I check the [Lonely Planet](http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com/) site about those places Reyn and I went to in Turkey, they seem to be overrun with tourists.  I mean, there were tourists when we were there, but not quite the locust plague I get the feeling it is now.
  

  
Of course that's internet forum information.  Forums are where everyone on the net goes to get crabby about something, so it might not be that bad.
