[Odd & The Frost Giants](http://www.amazon.ca/Odd-Frost-Giants-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061671738/) is a Neil Gaiman kids book about Norse mythology. It's about a boy named Odd with an infuriating smile who helps out some gods. It's very short, but told in that Neil Gaiman way that makes it seem like the story's always existed and he's just putting it down in new words. The thing I found the most interesting about it is how Thor Loki and Odin are portrayed compared with how he wrote them back in Sandman. These are (as befitting the kids story nature of the book) muppet versions of the gods. In any case, it was a cute little read.
