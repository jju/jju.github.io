This happened in Guang An: [2,000 attack hospital after boy, 3, dies](http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1676122006).  Guang An is just down the road from Nanchong, where I spent so much of my time the past couple of years.  My sources say Nanchong's internet was shut down Tuesday morning across the city.  Here's the [official crowd calming version](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-11/14/content_732216.htm&cid=1111143365).  Note how the doctors in this version immediately pump the child's stomach, instead of turning the grandfather away for having no money.  I wonder which one could possibly be true.  
  
And if you say the truth is somewhere in the middle, I'll probably punch you.
