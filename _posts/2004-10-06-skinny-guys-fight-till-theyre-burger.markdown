Today was a break from this playing basketball every day horrorshow I got myself roped into.  But what can I say?  It's sort of fun being a dominating presence even if I can't actually play the game.  If anyone has any strategy advice I'd love to hear it.  In the meantime I'll just go on being Abe Lincoln here and scab up nicely from some of the bigger hits.   
  
Also yesterday at Margie's, I ate with a fork for the first time in months.  I didn't even realize it until halfway through the meal.  And we had apple crisp for dessert.  Which was awesome.
