One of my farewell gifts from the kind folks at Intrepid was Alan Moore's [The Courtyard](http://www.amazon.ca/Moores-Courtyard-Color-Jacen-Burrows/dp/1592910602/), a Lovecraftian comic about an FBI agent investigating a bunch of unrelated homicides. Anomaly Theory he calls it. The story is nice and tight, but knowing a bit about mythos stuff sort of spoiled the big reveal. I knew long before the character did what was going on and how it was all going to end in tears. Thankfully, the reveal isn't the point of the story. It isn't trying to be uber clever so it doesn't really matter. It goes into some of that Alan Moore traditional stuff about time and our perception of it. Evidently he didn't do the script, Antony Johnston did. Beautiful book too. Jacen Burrows is one of those Avatar Press artists who makes comics I like to look at.
