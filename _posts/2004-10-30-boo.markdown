I'm trying to understand things here but some days it's really difficult.  Do the students like going to parties that include tests of how well they understood the wildspeaking foreign teacher?  What are they doing there then?  Is it for the juvenile bunnyhop song performed without apparent irony?  I try to think of Canadian students doing this kind of stuff willingly and my imagination comes up with a blue screen of death.    
  
Now, these were English department (ie. not the cool) kids and it's just a small college.  This probably doesn't happen in the big universities in Shanghai or wherever.  And lots of students weren't there.    
  
The party was divided into units!  "So now in the next unit we will play a game. . ."  It was bizarre.  
  
Nobody understood anything from my little talk about Halloween.  I cut out all the interesting things before hand, and they still couldn't follow it.  I feel like I need to do a radical overhaul to my personality when I talk to anyone here so I stop being anything like the self which nobody can possibly understand.
