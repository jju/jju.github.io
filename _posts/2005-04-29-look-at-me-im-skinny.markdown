Here's a bit of weirdness:  I got a bunch of business cards yesterday for me to use (eerily soon after Kate mentioned how she was about to get business cards for schmoozing purposes).  
  

  
The thing is that while they have my name on them, all the information is for my Foreign Affairs Office person, Miss Wang.  My email address isn't even on there.  So it's useful for me, since I can never remember Miss Wang's office phone number, but I probably didn't need 300 copies of said number.  So were I to use these things I'd still have to write my email address and/or telephone number on them.  This is information Miss Wang knows.
  

  
And the other thing is how my name is done.  Now I have a Chinese name, that I still don't like: An Ping (which means roughly: keep things calm).  People still ask why that's my name and I say that's what my teacher gave me.  I am the equivalent of those Chinese girls named Pudding.  
  

  
On the card it has "Justin AJ Unrau" in English.  That's what my passport says, so that's cool, but I must say it's weird seeing my full name written like that.  I never use more than "Justin" here.
  

  
Below my name in English is a new name in Chinese: An Ping (in characters) A. J. (in letters with periods) Ang Lao (in characters).  This new part means High Reward or something (there's also a meaning for that Lao that is "put somebody to the trouble of" which seems slightly less flattering).  
  

  
So now I have far more Chinese name than I know what to do with.  And it all seems very un-Chinesey.  And they all focus on the Unrau part of my name, instead of the much more sensible Justin area.  If An Ping wasn't on all my official documents (and now business cards) I'd just change the Chinese name to Jia Ting or something that sounds vaguely Justin-like and be done with it.
  

  
Oh Tan Laoshi why didn't you do that so many months ago?
