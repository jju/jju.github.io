Happy Birthday Tom Waits!  I went down to Times last night for a birthday party, filled with songs.    
  
I cringed for one group who did a Tom song, then said they were going to mic it up with a few of their own songs.  They played one of theirs and then a Tom song, but not a well known one.  After that song a guy started yelling at them to play some Tom Waits, and he got a bit of a Tom! Tom! Tom! chant going.  The cringing was because I did not want to see the singer scream her head off at them, which she sort of had the right to since they were being pissy about a song that was what they wanted.  I confess that I was pissed off that they'd play a non-Tom Waits song too, but three out of four were.  
  
What got me very angry (seething with rage) was the last group, who were musically awesomerriffic, but their goddamned singer didn't know the words to any of the songs.  He had a lyrics sheet that he kept peering at but it didn't help one bit.  And they did great songs, that I wanted to love but he ruined them (and then got pissy that people didn't sing along to Murder in the Red Barn enough).  
  
If I'm listening to someone cover Tom Waits I want someone who's dealing with the words; either being understandable or mucking around with them in a Tom Waits fashion, not blathering gibberish because he's drunk.  
  
I am intrigued by the upcoming Scarlett Johansson album consisting entirely of Tom Waits covers.  She is the one doing that, right?
