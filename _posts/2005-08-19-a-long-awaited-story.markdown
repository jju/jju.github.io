The Great Wall is very long and very old.    In some parts it is very crowded.  In some parts it is very beautiful.  I puked on it.  
  
After many discussions with colleagues who had been to the Great Wall a great many times I was part of a small group who wanted to see the Wall at dawn in addition to hiking along it all day with the rest of our large group.  This was before I knew I was going to vomit on it.  
  
We shuffled plans around a bunch but it finally worked out that we would hike with the big group from Jinshanling to Simatai and then spend the night there while the rest of them went home.  Where they had no further chance to barf on the wall.  
  
It was great.  We hiked and hiked and the weather was actually clear so we could see how long this thing really was and wonder why they built it along the lops of all these mountains, as if the mountains weren't wallish enough on their own.  This didn't make me hurl on the wall.  
  
The big group went home and eventually our small group came down and found a small place to stay and then went for dinner and beer while watching the sun set over a reservoir.  I ate a wonderful dinner and had no inkling that any upchucking was likely to occur.  
  
The next morning we got up at 4am to get out onto the Wall for sunrise.  The direction we were going was pretty much straight up so the climbing was, if not intense a little bit more exertion than I'm used to first thing in the morning.  This was my first warning that my stomach was soon to be evacuated.  
  
We got to a tower to rest and sit with a good view of the East.  There was absolutely no one up yet.  No one had asked for tickets; no one was trying to sell us stuff.  It was beautiful.  That's when I threw up.  
  
I left the tower moments before and spewed into some bushes outside.  Afterwards I felt much better, though I hadn't really been feeling bad until about 30 seconds before the purging.  
  
Then the sun came up and we all took pictures and climbed further before realizing we didn't have any food and probably shouldn't go the seventeen million towers to the end.  We headed back and ran into a roadblock demanding we pay for our early entry, which we eventually did.  Then we went back to Beijing.  Eventually we got something to eat.  I was quite hungry.
