Instead of working this morning I got on the bus and headed to the other end of town.  I always forget how long this city is.

The Bei Shan area isn't that exciting (I couldn't find the aquarium) but it's also where the giant new bridge across the Yangtze is.  This bridge is lit up at night and seems pretty impressive from far away.  There's already a bridge to Wu Qiao (where they're building another) and that one's pretty busy.

This one?  Dead.

It doesn't even connect up to the main road in the Bei Shan area in an immediately obvious way.  I had to go hiking through farms to get down to the bridge.

The motorcycle guys hanging out at the far end wanted to drive me back (I'd probably pay more than their usual runs of farmers into town) but I walked.  Got a bit of a sunburn too.

I wanted a couple of hockey sticks and a tennis ball out on that bridge.  And someone who knew what the hell they were.
