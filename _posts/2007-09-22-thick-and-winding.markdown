Through the miracles of previous cables and a coupler, I now have wired Internet in my room.  It's kind of silly how much cable this takes (the cable goes down from the router to the basement where it gets threaded through the ceiling into the sewing room then back up over the wall into the laundry area where it's connected to another cable that goes up through the floor into the storage room under the stairs then up through the stairs over the bathroom door then into my room), but if my computer refuses to detect the internet flowing through the air around it, there's not much else I can do.  And I didn't have to drill anything.  So that's a win.
