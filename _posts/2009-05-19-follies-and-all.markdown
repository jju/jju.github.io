My celebration of Victoria Day involved sending dirty pictures of myself to the queen. [I hear they like that](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=187) (they being queens). Plus I watched about half the Jays game and three episodes of The Wire's second season.

Earlier this weekend I bought my plane ticket to China, so that's going to happen.

On Saturday down at the library I completely missed an "incident" that needed a big ol' "incident report" written up about it. I was on my lunch break. This guy had been in earlier to use the viewing station to watch a DVD. When you sign up to use the TV you need to leave your name and a phone number or address (this was how I learned that Siloam Mission is at 300 Princess). This guy didn't want to leave his phone number/address with me. I asked and he said "You don't need that. I never give that." A coworker helped me out by saying that it actually is library policy and he needs to do it. He's a jerk and stalks off without leaving contact info. I shrug.

The guy returns an hour before his time is scheduled and the TV is free so we change the sign up sheet so he gets his two hours from the new time. Then he leaves half an hour early and another coworker asks him if he's coming back. He says maybe. Then I go for break.

Evidently when he returned he sat down without asking and was watching the TV and someone else had it booked and then he got mad when the library people came by to ask him to leave the TV so the person who'd booked it could watch and yeah. It wasn't a very big incident, but man, some people are assholes.

Not like the little lady who'd booked a TV last week and then decided to have a nap in the Large Type section. She lay across the aisle with her head on a bottom shelf. A page found her and came to the desk. I said "Excuse me!" a couple of times to the sleeping lady but she was right out and snoring. So I called security and they woke her up. She missed her booking because of her nap. That didn't require an incident report.

Anyway, we're closed Sundays till Labour Day and evidently "these economic times" are affecting my hours so it looks like my summer will have lots of free time (outside of Tuesday Wednesday Thursday afternoon/evenings).
