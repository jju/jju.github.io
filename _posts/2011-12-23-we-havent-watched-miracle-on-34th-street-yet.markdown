I'm in Virginia with Holly's family for Xmas. We got into Dulles airport yesterday morning after taking the redeye from Seattle. Tim and Krista, Holly's brother and sister-in-law, picked us up at the airport and drove us the couple of hours to Harrisonburg and Holly's home.

Holly's family (including parents Nancy and Harry, sister Amy) is really comfortable to hang around with. Everything's real relaxed and Holly's Virginia accent is strengthening by the moment. They have cows wandering the property. Yesterday after our (much-appreciated) naps we went up on a hike through the woods up the ridge behind their house. Out on the neighbours' property they have a firing range set up for shooting at targets from a hundred to a couple of hundred metres away down a hollow.

Today we drove into town to run some errands and it's kind of weird how spread out town is. It's a bunch of scattered little settlement areas around hills from each other with farms in between. We went to visit Holly's grandmother, got eggs from a dairy farm (I suppose there are also chickens around somewhere and these weren't artificially-shelled cow ova), and got cinnamon buns at a place Holly might get a job. We also saw the town's library, which was pretty decent, in a nice new building with friendly staff who recommended decent movies when they saw our stack of DVDs we were getting.

I think what I like best is seeing how happy Holly is to be home. I'm never this excited about being in Winnipeg. She's enjoying the smells of her town and how beautiful the different drives out to her parents' house are and running into people she hasn't seen in a long while and being able to tell them she's staying indefinitely.

The weirdest thing about being here is the lack of snow. It's like 11 degrees Celsius and there's no snow. I expected it to feel like fall in Vancouver, but this is a bit odd. The days are still pretty short though, so I don't quite feel like I haven't left Oz.
