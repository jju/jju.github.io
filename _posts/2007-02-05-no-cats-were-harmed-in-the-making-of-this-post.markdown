This is what happens when Reyn and Alison and I get all full up on pancakes.  And someone's missed a deadline for a martyr-themed art project.  The real pictures include bright orange flames licking at the cat's feet (not added via photoshop, but using the magic of Lego).  
  
My phone is now all messed up so I've got to restore from backups.  If you try calling me Monday morning and I take a while to respond that is why.  
  
Aileen's birthday party was last night and great fun was had.  My gift went over well and we talked about Rachael too much.  I now know I've met Bruce.  Know with my own brain.
