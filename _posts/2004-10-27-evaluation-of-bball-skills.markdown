I was supposed to give a lecture on Halloween tonight, but it has been cancelled because of the evaluation.  Everything around here is about this fricking evaluation.  Everyone is busy.  I keep on checking over my shoulder to see how much my classes are being scrutinized.  I don't want to be the reason they fail.  
  
I watched a bunch of basketball yesterday.  The English department girls kick a lot of ass, but that's mostly because their opponents can't shoot pass or dribble.  It's like watching a halfcourt game because the English department girls play a press all the time and 4 out of five times they force a turnover and score.  Yesterday they won 46-0.  There's one girl who can actually handle the ball well, but the rest do okay.  Sometimes.  
  
The English department guys get kicked around a lot.  I've got some pictures of them over on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/).
