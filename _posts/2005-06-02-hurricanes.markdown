It's kind of fun being in the middle of someone's big panicky crisis when it is completely not your fault and there is nothing you can do to help.
  

  
Today Miss Wang went to Chongqing for a meeting and to extend Margie's and my visas.  The thing about that is she needed two photos of me for the application.  
  

  
Yesterday at about noon she phoned and let me know, and I said "I don't have any photos.  Where can I get some done up?"  She told me to get them done on campus so I did.  The photographer said they'd be ready the next day.
  

  
I went back to Miss Wang, gave her my permit and my passport and said the photos would be ready tomorrow (today).  She was all worried because she was leaving in the morning.  I said I'd pick them up as soon as it opened at 8am and we'd be all good.
  

  
I got to the photographer's and she said they'd be ready this afternoon.  Oh, I'd misunderstood since we were speaking Chinese.  These things happen.
  

  
So I went to tell Miss Wang and then began a bunch of running around to find a place that could do new photos instantly.  It took a while and much franticness, but it got done.
  

  
It was so hard to stop from telling her that this was all her fault, not mine.  I did everything I was supposed to do when she told me.  But since telling people what is going to happen in advance isn't done in China, we run into problems.  I refrained from Margie-ing her with I told you sos, but had to let out my smugness somewhere.
