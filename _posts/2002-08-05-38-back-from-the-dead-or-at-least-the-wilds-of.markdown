Back from the dead or at least the wilds of the west I am.
A brief outline of my trip:

Last Saturday - drove 13.5 hours to my cousin's place in Cochrane (just outside Calgary)

Last Sunday - hung out with my cousin and S.O. (hiked, saw her horse, saw a house he was working on)

Monday - drove 7 hours to Kelowna, saw the house I lived in from age 0 - 2, drove down the road that my dad was killed on three times, visited some of my mom's friends from Kelowna (all at one dinner thankfully) and checked into the resort that we were staying at.

Tuesday - at the resort on Lake Okanagan, a little exploring a lot of relaxing.

Wednesday - at the resort, longer hiking, dinner at the posh restaurant, reading

Thursday - at the resort, golfed nine holes, went on a hike that my mom pansied out of

Friday - drove 7 hours to my aunt and uncle's in Calgary, spent the evening playing with my cousins' Lego

Saturday - did a bit of shopping (went to the Sentrybox, very nice)

Sunday - drove 13 hours home, had to take over the wheel once when my mom almost hit a car due to overtiredness.

Not a bad trip.  I now understand the urge to own property and got a better picture of my dad's final moments.  I'd always been under the impression that he was killed due to some other person's stupidity, but it was really his own impatience combined with two trucks and a narrow winding road on a cliffside (I kid you not).  You'd better believe I was careful driving that road.  I wanted no one to be dialing "I" for any reason at all.
