[An Open Letter to Journalism School Grads](http://alternet.org/mediaculture/22076/): 

<blockquote>Don't make your professors proud by shipping off to 'pay dues' at some Midwest daily unless you really do see yourself as the second coming of Seymour Hersh or James Agee or Calvin Trillin. My professors were certainly right that we need more reporters and editors who think of themselves as public advocates, but to insist that every j-school student should and will go down that path is to do you a disservice about the realities of your new profession. And it prompted me to do a disservice to them by tuning them out while I was in school. . . .
  

  
Because the reality is that the rebellion is more fun.</blockquote>

I'm a fan of open letters in general, especially one addressed to me (albeit a year late).
  

  
I didn't hate jskool the way some of my classmates did.  But yet I'm not out there journalizing at a newspaper (or Reuters where all the cool kids hang out).  Sometimes, lots of times, I get a little bit worried about how quickly I ditched that whole path.  It sort of did have to do with that entitlement idea when I didn't even make the first cut for the Donaldson scholarship dealy.  You know, you have an idea of what's going to happen and then inexplicably you aren't the centre of the universe and the plot passes you by.  Which led pretty directly to me coming to China.
  

  
That's right, it wasn't altruistic visions of teaching or [Zen poems](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/journalism.html#screaming) or the lure of the economic development or civet cats; it was disappointment.  How many rebellions start out that way?
  

  
And I realize that I'm not out here grabbing sound all the time to try and sell back to the CBC like I'd had a notion to when I came.  I'm not out here being a journalist.  And that's cool.
  

  
I'm also not out here being a part of some fantastic rebellion.  I'm just being here and seeing things and hearing lots that I don't understand.  And all I've really got to show for it is this personal account.  It's not a movement, it's not even relevant.  Just one person typing.
  

  
Clickety clack.
