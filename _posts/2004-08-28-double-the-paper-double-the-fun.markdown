I haven't looked forward to a weekend so much in a long time.  That said, I think my classes might be starting to go a bit better.  I've been chatting a bit with the students and they seem very nice and helpful.  Which is useful because it's nigh impossible to figure out how to get anything done here.
  

  
I did manage to get the printer working (despite Windows 98 being entirely in Chinese), but it's out of ink.  So I'm waiting on that and I have to go down to the English department to print anything off.  And then to photocopy it, I took some students to help me and we found out that we needed some forms saying why this photocopying needed doing.  I'd asked at the English department if there was anything I needed and they just said take a student along with you.  Anyway, it's not that big a deal.  It's just different from printing off a page and getting it copied.
