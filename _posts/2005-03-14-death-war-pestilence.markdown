From [an Alternet story on Wal-Mart](http://alternet.org/story/21398/):

<blockquote>Moving through Mexico stealthily in an old bus with its curtains drawn and slipping immigration officials the obligatory mordida (little bite, or bribe) to ease through the checkpoints, the smugglers arrived in Chihuahua City, 100 miles south of the U.S. border, drove out to an upscale suburb, and dropped their load off in front of an enormous Wal-Mart, informing the clueless clients they had arrived on "the Other Side." The Wal-Mart shared the gleaming mall with a Wendy's, a KFC, even an Applebee's, and the ten-plex "Hollywood" Cinema.  
  
"It looked just like how it looked on television" a rueful indocumentado told Froilan Meza of the local Chihuahua Herald.</blockquote>

Soon Wanzhou will be taking that little step towards looking like America.  The signs are up (or should that be nigh?) and renovations are ongoing.  We're getting a McDonald's.  
  
I cannot wait till opening day.  It'll be a madhouse and I'll be recording as much as I can.  I don't think any army guys'll be there to stop me.  Well they might be there but just to grab a burger or keep people from being trampled.  
  
Sadly, I'll probably use it.  I like sundaes.
