I did two things today (apart from class).  I handed in a third freaking exam for that student who failed and then cheated so she will get to pass.  When it comes back to me to mark I think I'm just going to write a 61 on it and hand it right back since the student is pretty much being guaranteed to pass the course.
  

  
The other thing I did was finished typing up Nowhere Near Barstow, my journal from when Reyn and I went traveling.  So now I've got this 80,000 word thing sitting on my computer as well as in the notebook next to me.  This is nice for me as now it's searchable and stuff since I'm trying to mine it for the RPG.net column and stuff.  
  

  
The other thing that I kind of like the idea of is that I could do it up as a little self-published print on demand book, using Cafepress.com or Lulu.com.  The thing with doing that is that there'd be the decision of whether I'd want it to go out rough like it is, as a journal, or go through it and polish up the style but good.  I'm leaning towards the polishing thing, but to do that will take a lot of time, so I'll most likely save that for next semester.
  

  
The other project which I have to get done by the end of August is a chapter on North American pop culture for a textbook aimed at Chinese non-English major students.  If you have suggestions for what I'd be an idiot not to include please send me an email.
