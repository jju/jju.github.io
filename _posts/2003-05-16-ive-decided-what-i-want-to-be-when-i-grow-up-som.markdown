I've decided what I want to be when I grow up; somebody's personal journalist.  The DJS5 can pimp me out to people who want news from their own personal reporter.  We'll have newsroom resources but without all the advertising costs because of the exorbitant fees we'll charge.  Speaking of which, I've been playing around with Freehand MX and I really want to learn to make Flash cartoons.  Not everyone's favourite speedster, but [Homestarrunner](http://www.homestarrunner.com)-style things.
