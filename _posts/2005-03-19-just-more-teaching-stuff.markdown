Today I had lunch with a couple of students (who just happened to spot me at the noodle shop).  It was good because it gave them a chance to tell me what they don't like about my class and what they didn't like about the class last term, so I can hopefully avoid both of these problems.
  

  
Last term the teacher basically wrote piles of words on the board. Which is really boring.  My problem is I talk too much and too loudly (everyone who read that and said "What?" or "Justin?" or "But your problem is that you never say anything, and when you do, you mumble, you jerk!" or otherwise expressed confusion at that description of me is a person I consider a friend - and has never seen me teach).
  

  
Some students say they want more definitions and things, but I'm going to throw different readings at them and put em in groups to discuss them.  I'm sure people will whine about not learning the difference between affecting something and effecting something.  Selah.
  

  
Aesion, one of my friends I've mentioned before, got his ass kicked by a bunch of guys with knives while he was innocently roller-skating this last week.  Supposedly he's got a scar on his face now.
