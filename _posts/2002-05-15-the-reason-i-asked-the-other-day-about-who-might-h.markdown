The reason I asked the other day about who might have written people is because I was thinking about how people figure out what to do in life.  Randomness?  Logic?  Some spiritual hooha?  To bring it back a bit, a year ago Andrea Loewen told me that I reminded her of Peter from The Brothers K (not Karamazov, K like a strikeout), or that Peter reminded her of me.  I cannot recall which it was.  At the time I stared at her blankly and apologized for not reacting more dramatically.  After, I thought about how much that situation bugged me.  "Damnit, I'm my own person, not some character in a book."  But then while thinking about it I wondered how much of me is patterned after Peter and how much of Peter just happens to be like me, because a different while back I was rereading some books I'd read in junior high and it was weird how much I resemble some of the characters or even just points of the stories.  Lately, I've been thinking about things that happen in a person's life and I was realizing that if you knew who would be writing you, and you knew that writer's work really well you'd be able to figure out what choice you should make because of all the situations that have been outlined in that writer's work.  So if, for example, you were written by Dostoevsky, you'd know that when bad things happened, what you should do is wallow in them, whereas if you were written by Hemingway you'd stand in the rain.  That kind of thing.  The real difficulty comes in with the fact that you have to know the writer's approach to things well to guess what you're going to do next.  See, because you can't follow the pattern of your own life very easily, but thinking of yourself as a character in someone else's book gives you that distance that lets you see the pattern and to consciously do what would fit (or not, because you have to break with patterns sometimes).  Or it could nicely serve as a convenient rationalization for the things that you've done.  Probably none of this makes much sense, but I was trying to justify my question, to say that it wasn't a question (like on those fuckass questionnaire forwards that I used to get so many of) that was just supposed to be answered cleverly.

Sorry my posts are being crappy pseudophilosophy like this, but I'm sure no one wants to hear about my struggles with wind and power rakes day after day after day, and I have problems making outrageous rants just for the hell of it.  Instead you get the distilled shit from my brain.  Mmmm...
