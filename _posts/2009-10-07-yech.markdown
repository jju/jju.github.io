I'm trying to write. I am. I've done three attempts at telling the story of heading up to the glacier from Moxi, and wearing the crampons and really wanting to peg the jerky Australian guy with a snowball, but it just isn't working. No gas in the tank. My application letters to these Library/Information schools are kind of sapping my will to do anything at all. I spent the weekend cleaning in anticipation of putting this stupid condo up for sale and the onerousness of that is encroaching on my brain. I am really sorry. When I'm better at this again I'll be back.
