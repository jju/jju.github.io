I did my part and went to see [Henry Selick](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0783139/)-directed [Coraline](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327597/) (2009) last night. If it had just been Selick's stop-motion movie I probably wouldn't have seen it opening night, but it's also a [Neil Gaiman](http://neilgaiman.com) book, so adding my dollars to the  opening weekend pool felt worthwhile. Apparently it does make a difference when you see a movie. Not when it's Dark Knight or something big, but when it's just a little one. I guess it matters for the big guys too, just not as much individually.

Anyway, the movie was good. I saw it at Grant Park in 3D. [John Hodgman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1894655/) and whoever did the cat were my favourite voices, and the stop-motion was beautiful. The whole actual quest part of the story felt like it went too quickly. I mean, it looked good and all, but sitting in the theatre it felt like there was tonnes and tonnes of buildup and then boom! it was all over. In a nice neat package. I should know better than to expect the same kind of introspection you get from a book. And maybe I brought all that slow pacing to the book myself. Who knows?
