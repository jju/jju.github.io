Sorry to be so late on this, but Reuters actually had [a story on Wanzhou](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK297898.htm)!  
  
Important differences between this story and what I've blogged:   
  
1. No one here has mentioned any looting, just the burned police car.  
2. Tear gas.  Wow.  Maybe I'm wrong in what those bangs were Tuesday night.  
3. The story doesn't talk about what they're doing to preserve stability (ie. all the cops)  
  
Of course the Reuters reporter is in Beijing and working over the phone and TV so it's understandable.
