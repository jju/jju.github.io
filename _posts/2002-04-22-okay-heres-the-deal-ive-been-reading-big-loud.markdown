Okay, here's the deal.  I've been reading [Big Loud's](http://seangiesbrecht.blogspot.com) blog for the past little while and asked him about why he does it and since he couldn't give me a good reason I figured that I didn't need one either.  But then I found one.  I'm talking about a reason for a blog, not necessarily a good one (reason or blog you may choose), but it works for me.  Tomorrow Ren and I shall purchase tickets for a non-stop thrill-ride adventure, and so I can use this to document the prep and possibly (depending on how I feel about this whole thing after doing it for a while) chronicle the trip as well.  And what the hell, I'll throw in other things too.
