I'm trying to get my blog here to mirror all the things I like about Facebook without having to go into Facebook to do anything. You may notice off to the right there's a Twittering box with the last three things I've been doing. I've got that set up to bounce into Facebook as status updates, and I can do that from my phone. Which I'm quite pleased with. You can also click on the Twittering title to go to my page and see other people's Twitters, most of which are more interesting than the statuses of people on Facebook (other than ones used as text messages of course).
