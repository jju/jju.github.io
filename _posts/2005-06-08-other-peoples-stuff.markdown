Richard Dawkins' article [Creationism: God's gift to the ignorant](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-196-1619264,00.html): 

<blockquote>The creationists� fondness for �gaps� in the fossil record is a metaphor for their love of gaps in knowledge generally. Gaps, by default, are filled by God. You don�t know how the nerve impulse works? Good! You don�t understand how memories are laid down in the brain? Excellent! Is photosynthesis a bafflingly complex process? Wonderful! Please don�t go to work on the problem, just give up, and appeal to God. Dear scientist, don�t work on your mysteries. Bring us your mysteries for we can use them. Don�t squander precious ignorance by researching it away. Ignorance is God�s gift to Kansas.</blockquote>

And from [Reporters without Borders](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2005/06/chinese_blogs_t.html) (link is to RConversation since in China you can't access RSF): 

<blockquote>A China-based blogger told Reporters Without Borders on condition of anonymity that the Shanghai police recently rendered his website inaccessible because it had not been registered. He then phoned the MII to ask what he had to do in order to register, and was told that in his case it was "not worth bothering" because "there was no chance of an independent blog getting permission to publish.</blockquote>

Happily, my site is hosted across the ocean in Vancouver, but this is important because if all the interesting political blogs in China get pushed overseas it's easy for the Firewall to shut them out.  
  

  
Not saying that my blog is political.  Hell, I forgot about the Tiananmen Square anniversary.  I've mentioned before how that was my first big world news story I remember.  Here you don't hear anyone talking about it.  [Wonder why](http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/bao.tong.html).  (Note: that last article is from 1999)
