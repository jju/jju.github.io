I like the variety of comments I've gotten about my Tuesday escapade.  From "Ha ha! You're going to die!"  to "This kind of thing happens in China.  Here are some other articles" to "I'm glad you're not dead. My life is boring" to "I'm so proud of you!"  But my favourite came from my friend who's in Taiwan and was seriously worried.  Like, more than my mom (who did call me on Wednesday to find out how worried she should be).  It's a different kind of propaganda machine there than here.  I forget about that sometimes.

The riot police are still surrounding the square, but they've got all these disco coloured strobing spotlights going.  If it's a camouflage attempt, it's not working.  And last night they were setting off fireworks down there.  Just to confuse me about the Tuesday explosions I'm sure.  I insist that what I heard on Tuesday was much more controlled sounding and at a higher pitch than the fireworks.  And there were fewer of them.  But I didn't see them, and I did see (and videotape) fireworks last night.

A student told me that in the original fight people flipped over three police cars.  He said he heard it from a guy in the fruit market, but despite that impeccable source (word on the street) I don't know if I believe it.  In fact, I'm sure I don't believe it.  But I wouldn't have believed a lot of Tuesday, so the information is there for your perusal.
