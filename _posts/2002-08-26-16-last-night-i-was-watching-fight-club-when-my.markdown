16
  

  
Last night I was watching Fight Club when my eye was suddenly impaled by something chemical (biochemical perhaps?).  Deafening pain ('cause saying blinding there would just be too easy, wouldn't it?), and what seemed like a quarter cup of tears overwhelmed me, though I had the presence of mind to pause the movie.  I staggered to the bathroom and flushed my eye out, then realized what I'd done and retrieved it from the septic tank so I could rinse it off.  Then it was fine.  I can see out it perfectly now.  In fact I threw away my glasses because the perfection of this eye overwhelms the crappiness of my vision in the other.  And all is well with the world.
