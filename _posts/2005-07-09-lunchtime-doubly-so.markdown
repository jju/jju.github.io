Nuts to that splitting things up by date crap.  I'm fully into vacation mode so time is an illusion.  We play fun games involving guessing what time of day it is based on nothing more than random chance.  Holly's been slipping and has been an hour off the past couple of tries.  
  
The train to Kashgar was excellent.  Double decker hard sleepers.  I was confused and thought we were in soft sleeper, they were that nice.  And in our compartment were a couple of Aussie guys, one of whom had spent the last 7 months in Canada, skiing and working at Camp Stephens (Lake of the Woods).  
  
Kashgar is way smaller than Urumqi and way less Han.  Of course five years ago it was probably all the mre pristine and is now a pale shadow of its former self, but Holly and I are first-timers so we ignorantly can't tell the difference.  The big Id Kah mosque was overflowing with people at prayer time on Friday.  It took forever for everyone to leave so we could get in and see these words from the Chinese government:

<blockquote>All of it [renovations to the mosque, including adding a washroom and 53 stores for management] shows fully that Chinese government always pays special attention to the another and historical cultures of the ethnic groups, and that all ethnic groups warmly welcome Party's religious policy.  It also shows that different ethnic groups have set up a close relationship of equality, unity and helps to eachother, and freedom of beliefs is protected.  All ethnic groups live friendly together here.  They cooperate to build a beautiful homeland, support heartily the unity of different ethnic groups and the unity of our country and oppose the ethnic, separatism and illegal religious activities.</blockquote>

There you have it.  And if you can't trust the Chinese government you live in a very sad world, my friend.  
  
Our first day we walked for hours and got stupidly stupidly lost but eventually found our way back by following the setting sun (and we couldn't remember how far away the horizon is so were unsure if the sun was even setting within China's borders anymore).  
  
We've been to parks and tombs and mosques and eaten skewer after skewer of lamb.  The nan has been somewhat disappointing but the yangrou is great.  Plus there's this chipped ice and yoghurt and syrup kind of thing that is awesome, and great ice cream and figs and peaches and these cumin seasoned meat things rolled up in crepes that are fried and rolled around in sugar.  We're all about the street food.  
  
We're also all about the guilt.  So many people you meet out here are doing amazing things: heading into Kazakhstan, cycling through Uzbekistan, taking buses through the desert.  We're just hanging out and seeing stuff.  Which is fun and relaxing but I get kind of freaked out that we're a third done the holiday portion of the summer.  
  
We've tentatively added another stop to our travels.  One of Holly's friends lives in Xian so we're going to head there and see him and the terracotta warriors on our way out East.  That should be a week from now.  
  
Oh! A guy tried to pick my pocket tonight and it gave me the chance to do something I've always wanted to do in a crowd: elbow a skinny guy in the chest really really hard.  Now I've practiced and am primed for tomorrow's Sunday Market.
