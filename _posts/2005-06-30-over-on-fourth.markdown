My newest [G2H2 column](http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/g2h229jun05.html) is up at [RPG.net](http://www.rpg.net).  This one's about markets and other shopping experiences.  
  

  
There are a few exaggerations involved in it.  Not every shop in the vicinity of the school sells toilets.  Some just sell pipes.  Or lightbulbs.  
  

  
Hopefully up in Xinjiang this summer I can find one that just sells cowboy hats.  I am sadly lacking in Chinese accoutrements, and I can't think of anything better than a cowboy hat to fix that.
