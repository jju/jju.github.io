Storytime last night included the kid shaped like a potato (he's developmentally disabled in such a way he has no neck or concept of "inside voice") and a couple of others getting a bit too into it, all standing up and trying to point out everything they saw on the pages, and I realized I'm really not equipped to calm kids down. I blame China, where I was so horribly boring a teacher I needed to jazz up everything and never did it very much. Five-year-olds are much easier to jazz up, as I have learned. Even though I did a story I really liked but that was way metaphorical about Fall being Mother Earth's wild child who wouldn't go to bed. Cool story; not so great with a bunch of kids who didn't get it.

I have an interview for a new job down at the Falcon next week. My current job at Intrepid is a temporary position and if I reach the end of the temporary time and the person I'm replacing comes back then I get bumped back to being a bookstacking page. So I've been keeping my eyes open for permanent part-time positions that are a bit closer to home (ie the Falcon or Speedy). This position I applied for includes working Sundays and a couple of 6 hour shifts a week so the same hours I'm getting at Intrepid, but condensed into fewer days. Which is nice. The other benefit would be not having to bike to work, as the Falcon's within walking distance, so it's cheaper.

Was there anything else? Oh yeah, I played D&D last night with the branch head from Heart of Gold and some of his friends who I vaguely remember from my days at Campaign. I had a good enough time, but the 2.5 hour combat (that still isn't over) made me miss our Reign game. Reign's just a better game and well, my friends are way more fun to play with. More inventive, less apt to treat their characters like playing pieces on a board, way more into doing cool shit. It's too bad about all our scheduling conflicts these days.
