I got back an assignment today.  Just a little writeup of a traffic accident.  A boring story that nobody not even a dog died in.  And it turns out that I kicked the story's ass.  6 times.  With hobnailed boots.  Coated in AIDS filled monkey jizz.  So it turns out that I'm not imagining that this stuff isn't hideously difficult.  Which made me happy.  The first assignment I got a bit wordy on, but I read a bit of Hemingway before this one and set myself up nicely.  Before the first one I'd been reading Kundera.  What was I thinking?

I heard someone talking about Strongbad emails on the bus today.  I won't follow that up with anything about how the speaker was dumber than a sack of skinned puppies.  Nope.
