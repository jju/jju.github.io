I have a meeting tomorrow morning. It was supposed to be tomorrow evening in a darkened and empty office building, but it got changed today. The person I asked to find out why it was happening in the dark of night in a building with no witnesses is the person who informed me it was happening in the daytime instead. She said it was a typo. I don't know.

I wonder what would have happened if I'd shown up at the time these mysterious meeting organizers actually asked me to. Would I truly have had a bag tossed over my head and been driven to a quiet road on the outskirts of town and shot twice? Left to die in a snow-muffled thud? Of course I wouldn't have. That's not how the world works. It's laughable to even suggest such a thing.
