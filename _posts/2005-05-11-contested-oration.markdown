Last night was a speech contest.  I must say judging a speech contest is way less tedious than judging an English short play contest.  
  
The topic that everyone was speaking on was "The Greatest Invention in my Eyes (not including the Internet)."  I laughed at the parenthetical note because it was on all the posters and the Powerpoint backdrop and everything.  It was to warn people that if they thought they were going to hear about the Internet they would be disappointed through no fault of the speaker.  So don't go rioting or anything.  
  
As a judge in these things we are supposed to look at Intonation and Pronounciation, Skills, Presentation.  Note the absence of content from that list.  I usually popped content into the skills section.  One girl did a lot of research for her speech on soap and it seemed a shame not to reward her.  
  
The stressful part for me was coming up with questions to ask them.  They had impromptu speeches and had to answer questions from either me or Margie.  There were lots of interesting questions to ask that there's no way the students would understand (or if they did, wouldn't have the vocabulary to answer with), so I tended towards softball questions that I figuref they'd be able to say something about.  
  
Margie kept on haranguing them though.  She asked one girl what Asian country she thought should get a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and then was laughing at her (on mic) for not being able to come up with one.  The poor little English major just didn't want to get caught in saying something politically stupid.  I gave her extra marks to make up for Margie being a jerk.  Another time she went off on her own speech about Yao Ming not fitting her image of a model worker and kept on interjecting when the girl said she thought Yao was a model worker with "convince me!"  I kept on scrunching down low in my chair when Margie was talking.  And I figure the next time she gives a public lecture I'll let some of my jerklike tendencies to show through when she opens it up to questions.  
  
In the end the girl who won was the one who deserved to win (and had spoken about bicycles being the greatest invention), and the whole thing only took a couple of hours.  
  
I also had a good little chat afterwards with one of my favourite first year students.  Candy (there's one in every class) is very articulate and I felt bad handing back her midterm today because she really didn't do very well.  I'd assumed she'd get one of the top marks in the class, but she was somewhere on the low end.  I don't think she holds it against me though.  I always feel bad giving the smart kids crappy marks because I know how much it bothers them.  
  
But cheering from around the campus just alerted me that someone just scored in the Shandong-Yokohama (read: China-Japan) football game on CCTV5 so I'll be off.
