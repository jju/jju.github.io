No posts all week.  Lousy punk.  Unlike Sean Ren and Hassie I'm not out gawking at symbols of the north american military industrial complex today.  Nope, today I 'm going to go down to the new MEC store, and read a textbook on Modern India's State and Politics that I bought for a class that I didn't take.  In retrospect, I probably should have taken it, just so I could say "don't worry guys" with some sort of backup when family members start to freak out about The Rev and I travelling into a potential nuclear war zone.  Pansies all of them, just like the Canadian government advising people to leave.
