A bit on [the psychology of magical thinking](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/23/psychology_of_magica.html): 

<blockquote>"I think in part it's because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts, they are most salient to us" - and thus we are likely to overestimate their connection to outside events.</blockquote>

That's true, I am constantly exposed to my own thoughts!  This can be part of the writer complex too methinks.  Or maybe it's an only child thing.  Whatever.  I'm fucking magickal.  
  
In other news, Kid Koala put on a wicked show.  Kate and I bought merch basically because he was doing his own selling.  I told him how Kate wrote a paper on him once, and he demanded to see it (she did not have it with her).
