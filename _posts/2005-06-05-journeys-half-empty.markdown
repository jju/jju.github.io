Some random things from a rainy day:  
  
Last week Margie tried to tell me that the first Star Wars movie didn't have Episode IV or A New Hope on it when she first saw it.  I explained that back then it wasn't on the posters or anything, but it was right there in the crawl at the beginning of the movie.  And she, in her Margie kind of way, said that I was wrong and it never said anything but Star Wars anywhere in the '70s.  
  
Usually when she says stuff that I'm pretty sure is wrong I let it slide; I am the bigger man, and there's no real point in arguing with her.  Even when she's wrong she'll go on defending her point of view for half an hour longer than everyone's forgotten about it, so it's easier to just let her live in her veil of wrong assumptions.  But this was retarded.  There was no way I was backing down.  
  
I told her she was incorrect and I didn't even get mean about it.  Partially because she never seems to understand it when my remarks put on their snidey-suits.  And the amazing part of the story for me is that she capitulated (well, she changed her statement from "it wasn't there" to "I don't remember seeing it" which is about as good as it gets).  The argument didn't go on for the multi-houred attritional war I had prepared myself for.  Victory, of a sort, was mine!  
  
It'll be weird next year with a bunch of foreign teachers here to see how each of them deals with her.  Some people like her energy.  Some people don't mind her in small doses.  Some people flee when they see her coming.  But none of the foreigners coming next year are part of our unnamed organization so they aren't contractually obligated to try being nice.  And they aren't Canadian so there won't be that ingrained politeness thing going on either.  
  
Today it's been raining Stetsons and Steinways.  And by that I mean people whose names have become objects have been falling out of the clouds overhead.  Because of this deluge I'm really glad I didn't go climb a mountain with one of the first-year classes today.  It was pouring at 7am anyway and you'd think that they'd call things off, but in my experience they'd go on with it simply because I was along and they wouldn't want to inconvenience me by cancelling, even though it inconvenienced everyone who had to climb a frickin' mountain in the rain.  This is just my perception which may be completely off base (to use a casual phrase that requires way too much explanation for people who don't have a vague comprehension of America's national pastime).  
  
So instead I played Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.  Good game, even though I suck at it.  The other thing I did was finish reading the [Scary Go Round](http://www.scarygoround.com/) archives.  I miss madcap adventures and silliness in my everyday life, which should be much more than an [empty journey to triumph](http://www.scarygoround.com/?date=20050523).  
  
Now I have some marking ahead of me, and a phone that isn't working for some reason.
