Last week after the first presidential debate The Daily Show did a post debate analysis.  I downloaded [a copy](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/02/daily_show_on_the_de.html) and watched it.  And laughed.  
  
One of my newspaper classes is ahead of the other three so tonight as a reward I talked about what being a reporter is actually like (yawn) and in the second hour played the video for them.  I paused to explain some of the jokes afterwards and some of them beforehand.  They loved the line about a retarded man taking on a sitting senator.    
  
There were some comments in the interview segments (between Jon Stewart and Wesley Clark and Rudy Giuliani - not at the same time) about China and North Korea and multilateral talks that might get me in trouble, but I'm not sure the students caught them.  I'd completely forgotten about them when I decided to show it.    
  
But then we (I) talked about humour in news reporting and how important The Daily Show is.  Great class.  While the video was playing the number of students in my classroom doubled.
