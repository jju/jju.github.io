There was a documentary on Newsworld tonight called Up the Yangtze. It was about a couple of kids working the tourist river cruises that swung by my old home (though the never showed Wanzhou specifically). I watched and recognized people. Not actual individuals but people who showed the exact same personalities King or Vivien or other students I'd taught. And the woman who worked in the kitchen who reminded me of the woman who ran the restaurant with the AC and grimy plastic curtain. Made me miss China. It was so grey and green and brown, just like I remember it.
