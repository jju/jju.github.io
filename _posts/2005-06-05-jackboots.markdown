Every couple of weeks in my American Culture class I give them a question to write a few paragraphs about.  Basically it's because they won't engage in any sort of discussion in class, so I get to read a bit about what they think about this culture.
  

  
A couple of weeks ago we talked about social problems, including crime.  Their homework question was, "What would you do to fight crime in America?"
  

  
What a cute little pile of fascists.
  

  
Granted, many of them talked about educating children in good moral values, but **all** of them talked about more laws, bans on guns, bans on violent media images and severer penalties.  Many thought it very strange that all states didn't have a death penalty.  
  

  
The creepiest thing was how a bunch of them suggested putting homosexuals in jail.  I'm hoping there's a miscommunication involved there and they aren't all going to be sporting little moustaches the next time they go out goosestepping.  We'll try straightening that out this week.
  

  
And a bunch of people put in a line from the textbook about how the cause of crime is America's capitalist system.  I asked all of them "Why is there crime in non-capitalist countries then?" but didn't dock any marks.  (I did dock marks for the homo-imprisoners.  I wouldn't have been at all comfortable with myself giving an answer including throwing all gay people in jail a check mark.)
  

  
Nobody said they wanted to don a colourful suit to go and punish criminals themselves.  Which was kind of disappointing.
