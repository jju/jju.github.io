I have had a busy weekend making stuff, which is a pretty good way to spend my time, even if it is technically for homework.

I'm doing a video booktalk/trailer for an excellent YA pirate novel (A.S. King's [The Dust of 100 Dogs](http://librarianaut.com/2010/03/31/book-review-the-dust-of-100-dogs/)), and I own a bunch of pirate Lego, so using that Lego to illustrate the trailer seemed like a great idea. A few weeks ago I supplemented my Lego collection with extra hairpieces and some less masculine torsos and I was good to go. 

Now, everybody in class has to make a video, but you can also just do a video booktalk. Getting out the Lego and building sets and taking umpty million macro shots isn't a course requirement. But I've realized this term that what I'm really excited about in librarianship is doing cool stuff with young people. Playing with Lego and making something cool to show people is something I'd actually like to do professionally (and doing media-creation YA programs is something libraries can get into). This was completely the kind of project I can get lost in. If only all homework was like this (I'm sorry to my friends in cataloguing this term).

As of now I've got 30 pictures for my 90 second trailer and I've figured out exactly what gaps need filling. I need to do at least one more action sequence, a leaving home sequence that'll recall the one already shot in the other timeline and a handful more Lego dogs (so I can turn them into 100).

I also appear to have left my phone in my jacket pocket with the ringer off since Friday night and never even thought about looking for it, so engrossed was I in Lego. Apologies to the person who tried to call me.
