I was going to post something reflective about how it was to only catch the tail end of the poor choices summer.  I was going to post a report on the Labour Day Classic weekend (completely disregarding the whole "what happens on the road stays on the road" agreement that was made while I was in the room not agreeing to it).  But I didn't.

I'm going back to London today.
