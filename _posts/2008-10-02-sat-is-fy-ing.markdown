I have had an excellent 24 hours. 

Yesterday morning I went to help my mom put together her new bed for the guest bedroom and in exchange she bought me Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book! I'd told her I could just use a ride to McNally so I could buy it, but I will not turn down a free book. TGB was up in McNally Grant Park's children's section which made it a bit tougher to find. The girl at the counter didn't realize it was even out yet. And we also found Mom a book to read. She says she's going to turn back into a reader, and not just a reader of trash either. We'll see how long that lasts but as long as it does I'll be happy to recommend books.

At the library last night I rocked the fuck out of my first family storytime. If there was any fuck in those kids when it started BAM! it is gone now. No, nothing traumatic occurred. I was just keyed up and silly and plowed through when I forgot words to the songs (or more importantly the rhythms the words went to). The kids, as predicted, loved helping me out when I made mistakes on Old MacDonald - "E-I-E-I-X!" - and I probably went a little overboard on that, but what the hell. I didn't have to do anything to get them to settle down which was nice. There wasn't a tonne of kid feedback, but that is one thing I'm used to from China teaching, so I just did my thing and let them follow along, still sort of shocked by the madman bouncing around up front.

And then this morning I woke up to find an email from the fiction editor at [Broken Pencil](http://www.brokenpencil.com/) asking if a story I'd sent them long ago was still available, because they'd like to publish it. I didn't have it on any other editor's doorstep at the moment so through a flurry of emails I've now sold another of my stories.

After that, I finished reading the Graveyard Book and just loved the hell out of it. Very quick (of course - it is a kid's book) but beautiful. The kind of book I wish I could read to the kids at the library as part of my Halloween program, but I'm told the attention span for stories without pictures is something like 3/4 of a page. When I was in elementary school teachers read chapter books to the kids, didn't they? I was really hoping I'd be able to do like a ten page extract about the Danse Macabre, but I doubt it will happen.
