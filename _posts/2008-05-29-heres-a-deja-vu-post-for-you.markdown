It's silly how much difference a day makes. Today my pages were super smooth and everything went fine. No abandoning the book, not when it's two thirds done. I can't wait for this first draft to be over, mind you. I want to start typing it up and actually doing the work on it to make it good. Because it can be. This is basically just a really really detailed outline version of What Happens. Once it's done then I can get into the styley cool bits. 

That's the difference between doing fiction and my normal blogging/travel journalling. In those things (which I find way easier than what I'm doing now) I'm describing something that's already happened. Picking the interesting things to highlight and the way to say it and stuff. Right now I'm still in the process of finding out what's happening. Which is pretty good on its own. Today a mob of disgruntled slovenly people began throwing rocks while traffic diverged around them unnoticing. I didn't know that was going to happen when I woke up.
