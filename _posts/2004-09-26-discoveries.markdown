I just found an extra pack of minidiscs that I brought with me, including the recording from that party at Jared's in 2002.  I might have to go through it and make some of those pre [Poor Choices](../anpc.html) things public again.  Since I lost the old mp3s.  I love the horrible version of Cold Cold Ground they did.  And who can forget Big Loud's Lesbians Should Have the Right to Adopt Children blues?  I can't.
