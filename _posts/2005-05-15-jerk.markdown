I like some of my students, but the past couple of days I've just gotten pissed off meeting them outside the campus.  
  

  
One first-year, Jesse, was out for a walk. I was not out for a walk, but just heading down to the river to sit and watch the boats (yes I am the most exciting person in the world).  But because he saw me he felt the need to sit there with me and go back to the school when I did and all that.  I told him a couple of times that I didn't mean to interrupt his walk (even though he was the one who did the interrupting) but he didn't go back to whatever he was doing.  It's not like we were having scintillating conversation.  He was trying to come up with something to say and failing.
  

  
Then last night I accidentally went into a restaurant where some of my students were eating (including Jesse).  He came over to "help" me order.  Now this is one of the places I go all the time and I know what I like and know how to write it on the order sheets so I told Jesse I was fine thanks.  Then the monitor from that class came over to "help" and I told her I was not actually a mewling babe in the woods and I didn't need help.
  

  
I really like it when I see students in the street, can say hi, comment on their new haircut and walk away.
