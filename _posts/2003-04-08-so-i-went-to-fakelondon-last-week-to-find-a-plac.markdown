So I went to (fake)London last week to find a place to live and to Ottawa to see Aileen and Kate and despite initial setbacks and a stupidly winterish storm, it all went well.  My lease has been signed and it's a cool little apartment that I'm not sharing with anyone, 'cause being an only child and all, I figure it'd take about twenty minutes of having a roommate before he or she would end up dead.  I saw the parliament buildings on Saturday and tried to see the museum of civilisation on Monday, but our nation's capital has decided that only lunatics would want to see a museum on a Monday, so in the interests of identifying people with mental aberrations they have closed all the museums on Mondays and have a team of scientists with nets and tranquilizers to apprehend anyone who shows up at the door.  Needless to say I escaped a lifetime of soft walls and overly tight jackets and managed to return to Winnipeg on the same plane as the Duhks, members of whom you might remember from being Scruj MacDuhk, who were returning from a winless (yet still enjoyable) weekend at the Juno Awards.  Interesting note: violin strings count as dangerous weapons and are thusly confiscated by airline security people.
