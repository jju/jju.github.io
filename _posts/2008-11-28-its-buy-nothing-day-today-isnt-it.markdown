I've had a good month for mail. This week I received a letter in which the writer said "I promised myself I would write back right away because you are a writer and writers need letters, much like I need garlic bread." And you know what? It's true. Getting a letter is pretty great. If you are doing a Buy Nothing Christmas or something along those lines consider writing letters to people (like me). Good letters. Not Christmas/Holiday Letters meant to update the whole world on what's been happening (not knocking your annual email Sean, it's just not quite what I'm talking about here), but a pen and paper, brain spilling session that gets mailed before you can read over it too carefully. I like them a lot.

(But if you do want to _buy_ me a present [here's my Amazon.ca wishlist](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/registry/wishlist/BI1WGB2CZJLD?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=compact&x=11&y=13).)

Down at Intrepid things proceed apace. I don't have a start date for the new position yet, and am still plugging away at Targ's work for three months from now. I'm almost done her entire winter session of Baby Rhyme Time handouts and wonder if she'll set me to the spring session too. We have a New Year's program happening that I haven't done much (read: anything) to prepare for, but that's okay by me as it isn't my program and never was.

The Punjabi man who had problems printing a while back is still in every day working on his citizenship/residency application stuff. He asks me questions about spelling and letter formatting which I'm comfortable answering, but he also is asking me if the documents he has are the right ones and sufficient for what the government wants. Those questions I answer with the repetitive "I don't know" since, funny enough, I am not an immigration lawyer. I think he said he was finishing things up today.
