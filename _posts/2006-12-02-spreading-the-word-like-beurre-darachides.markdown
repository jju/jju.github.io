WCN allowed me to upload last week's comics, which are conveniently located in a bunch [in the archives](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/series.php?view=archive&chapter=14071&name=pingouink). Whew.  I was getting worried about it.  
  
I made three batches of pudding last night.  Like, I cooked it on the stove and ruined two of Alison's pots.  But it's good chocolate pudding.  Tastes kind of like toasted marshmallows.  Then I mixed it with a tasty non-hydrogenated edible oil product and torn-up angelfood cake and Skor bars, making a delicious dessert for extended-family Christmas tomorrow.  
  
I actually read through the new issue of [Geez](http://geezmagazine.org) this morning, and I think the best thing in there is the (solicited) response to the mag from this evangelical ministry called [The Way of the Master](http://wayofthemaster.com/).  It's called "Top 10 reasons Geez gets up my nose" and it's the most legitimately informative thing in the whole mag (on page 44 if you have the issue).  I disagree with writer Todd Friel's point of view, but it's laid right out there, which makes it easy to argue with in good faith.  
  
UPDATE: I just realized this is my blog's 1000th post.
