Today I gathered texts for assignments all day. Woo. Our management class has its first assignment due in a couple of weeks, and that requires a whole hell of a lot of books on management and economics and libraries to be annotated for a bibliography. Don't you wish you were in library school?

Doing this kind of thing is much easier than I imagine it used to be when you couldn't lie in bed with your laptop all day, reserving books from all over the area to be delivered to places conducive to being picked up, or just getting the documents loaded onto your computer. I did go out to the VPL to grab a stack of books. Just for the thrill of going to the library and hurting my shoulder by overloading my bag.

And I did laundry and bought groceries. Wee. Exciting. Aren't you glad I'm writing about this?

So many of my classmates seem so much more busy than me. All with their multiple jobs and things. I've just got my classes and the assignments, which I might as well do now since maybe I'll be getting a job at some point to cut into my schoolwork time. This term I don't have any pressing reason to get my school stuff done early, but I've kind of gotten the habit started so it seems better to be working on that stuff than not. It's basically procrastination from writing or thinking about the future to be working on homework.
