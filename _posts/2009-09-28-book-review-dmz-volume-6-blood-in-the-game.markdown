Brian Wood's SF journalism comic DMZ is my favourite ongoing comic series, and [Blood in the Game](http://www.amazon.ca/DMZ-Vol-6-Blood-Game/dp/1401221300/) tickled me in all the right ways. The trades for this book are almost self contained story arcs which is nice. This one is about the election in New York. And this one kind of steps over the line where Matty Roth (who started off as a journalism intern dumped into a war zone, and is now the only independent(ish) news voice in the war zone that is New York) goes into activism instead of just reporting. I expected a shift but I didn't expect him to get co-opted so quickly.
