Here's an excellent [article](http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_riverbendblog_archive.html#110815850766514443) from [Baghdad Burning](http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com), a blog by a 24 year old Iraqi woman:

<blockquote>�Please dress appropriately next time you come here.� The man said to me. I looked down at what I was wearing- black pants, a beige high-necked sweater and a knee-length black coat. Huh? I blushed furiously. He meant my head should be covered and I should be wearing a skirt. I don�t like being told what to wear and what not to wear by strange men. �I don�t work here- I don�t have to follow a dress code.� I answered coldly. The cousin didn�t like where the conversation was going, he angrily interceded, �We�re only here for an hour and it really isn�t your business.�
  

  
�It is my business.� Came the answer, �She should have some respect for the people who work here.� And the conversation ended. I looked around for the people I should be respecting. There were three or four women who were apparently ministry employees. Two of them were wearing long skirts, loose sweaters and headscarves and the third had gone all out and was wearing a complete �jubba� or robe-like garb topped with a black head scarf. My cousin and I turned to enter the room the receptionist had indicated and my eyes were stinging. No one could talk that way before the war and if they did, you didn�t have to listen. You could answer back. Now, you only answer back and make it an issue if you have some sort of death wish or just really, really like trouble.</blockquote>

Freedom is on the march everyone!
