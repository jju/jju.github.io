47
  

  
So yesterday I went down to Primal Art at 5:30 for my tattoo appointment and was told that Jeff was at a doctor's appointment that had taken way longer than he'd expected, and there was a girl who'd been scheduled for 3pm, and he wasn't back yet, so could I wait till later.  I said sure and gave them my mom's cell phone # to let me know when I should return.  They called, I went back at nine, but the girl before me was only done at about 10:10.  Luckily my tattoo is small and easy to do, nothing really finicky, only one colour.  He asked a few times if I was nervous about it, and I really wasn't.  I knew what I wanted and that this wasn't a huge mistake, so there wasn't anything to be nervous about.  Putting the design on went exactly like I said it would.  He had a photocopy of the design that he stuck into this machine to make a sort of press on tattoo copy.  We positioned that stencil where I wanted it (inside left forearm up by my elbow) and had a brief moment of confusion when he had it oriented upside down, but we caught it before any harm was done.  He used a number four needle and the tattoo gun thingy is hooked up to a little box that he can adjust the voltage on (which I assume controls the speed of the needle).  My arm rested on a little padded tray while I sat next to it.  He held my arm steady and did a short line so I'd know what it felt like.  Yeah, it hurt while he was doing it, but it feels completely fine now (not to say I'm going to be playing any volleyball real soon, but it's fine for living).  So I've got a little bottle of cream that I'm supposed to start using on it tomorrow twice a day, just a tiny bit.  I can't get it wet for a couple of weeks (Saran Wrap becomes my new shower friend), I'm not supposed to sun it for a month, and after a month I should use sunblock for it.  Now, it is on the inside of my arm where it is pretty fishbelly anyway, but just to be safe I'll be wearing longsleeves for work for a while.  So that was the process.  He made fun of how quick it was and how it was a waste of a needle.  The actual tattooing took maybe 20 minutes.  Jeff the tattooist was also the first person who has responded with out and out racist comments when I told him about where Ren and I are travelling.  So, there I gave it: the boring mundane story of me getting a tattoo.
  

  
Tomorrow morning I leave for BC on my last family road trip for a (hopefully) long time.  But all my bags are packed so I'm up for doing cool stuff tonight.
