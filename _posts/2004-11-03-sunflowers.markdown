Theo van Gogh's murder would have been more of an issue I'd mention if it hadn't been for the election.  Props to [Chris Evans](http://updates.takingitglobal.org/read/chrisevans) for indirectly shaming me about my own day's blogging.  
  
Read more about this in the [Guardian](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1342101,00.html), or on [CBC.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2004/11/02/Arts/filmvangogh041102.html).  It's really a crappy story and it's one of those reasons why governments need to be dealing with actual terrorists instead of trumped up targets for war profiteering.
