Okay, I admit, I read the occasional book on writing. [How to be a Famous Writer Before You're Dead](http://www.amazon.ca/Become-Famous-Writer-Before-Youre/dp/030734648X/) passed through my hands at the library a few days ago and looked intriguing, so I requested it myself. Ariel Gore has a zine ethic she brings to the thing which you don't always see in these kinds of books. Talking about how self-publishing doesn't equal vanity publishing and all that kind of stuff. There are interviews with a bunch of interesting people (including a fake interview with Haruki Murakami because he doesn't really do interviews any more) including Ursula K LeGuin and Margaret Cho. Not life-changing, but reading one of these books every once in a while is good for me.
