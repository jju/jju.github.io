I love how differently time passes when you aren't counting down to some event. And since I'm trying a new subtlety tack that's all I'm going to say about that.

We've been hanging out with the people in our house more since Holly arrived. Last night we looked at Carola's pictures of Patagonia for a long time, which was fine, it's all very beautiful, but it got more interesting when she was showing us pictures of Valpariso and there was a mural featuring an oldish man in a suit she referred to as "my leader." Then we got her to tell us the story of this leader and how he killed himself when the military staged its coup, and she was very serious about this history. 

Now, I don't know a lot about history in South America, but that sounded like the 1973ish coup. Allende and Pinochet such. [The other 9/11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'%C3%A9tat). So I had to ask, "But this all happened before you were born right?" Of course it did. But it was interesting to hear her talk about this leader she never had as hers.

There was a lot more to the story, including cousins who're rebels and uncles in the military. "We don't talk very much about it because everyone has different opinions," she said. It was fascinating. And something I wouldn't have heard, had I been sitting in my room on the internet.

We've also been kind of awesomely domestic. The expense of things encourages  it. I made a potato, chick pea and apple curry the other day. Holly's made soup and white sauce for pasta, and a bunch of other stuff. We're eating salad and [drinking tea](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/5911617499/in/photostream/). We're having pancakes on Saturday and then going bike shopping.

It's pretty sweet being here/now.
