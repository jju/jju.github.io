I love wandering around at night eating an ice cream treat and finding out a wushu demonstration is going on.  I love that people in the PE department here can major in gongfu.  I love hearing the FWAP! those flimsy fake swords make.  I love how the one girl doing taichi completely forgot her moves.  I love watching people do flips.  
  
I also love peach-ade.
