The problem with trying new foods here is how often you find yourself with a mouthful of organs.

I picked up my mail today and it was a glorious imaginary Christmas.  A poncho-y fleece.  A DJS5 toque.  A pile of Maclean's magazines.  It was worth having to explain to the FAO that yes I was back for a little while, and yes I would still be going to Hong Kong.
