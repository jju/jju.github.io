I'm wearing my DMZ shirt with the PRESS label flipped to the visible side today.  That's because I have now been credited with doing "additional reporting" for Wired.com.  [The story](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/05/assignment_zero_citizendium) is on the emergence of [Citizendium](http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Page) as an alternative to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).  I'm doing some stuff with this [Assignment Zero](http://zero.newassignment.net) thing because it's neat and I have the time to do so.    
  
It's kind of disorganized and if you don't jump up and say this is what I want to do because it's really really really important, you kind of get left behind.  That's a bit of a problem for me because of my inability to think what I do is important at the best of times.  
  
Kazuo Ishiguro said it very well (in words to this effect): "Journalism is about working yourself up into a lather over something you previously felt nothing about.  It is diametrically opposed to what you do as a novelist, which is to very slowly discover what you feel about things."  I fall much more naturally into the second of those two.
