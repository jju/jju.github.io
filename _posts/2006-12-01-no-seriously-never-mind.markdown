What is up with the guldarned internet these days?  WCN still isn't letting me upload my comics, Librarything won't let me log in, and I guess that's it.  But when it's two things I want to do it feels insurmountable.  Oh.  Now Librarything is working again.  Never mind my defeatist attitude.  
  
The new issue of [Geez Magazine](http://geezmagazine.org) is out.  This is the one with my article in it.  I did some work on the narrative arc (which you may remember me talking about) but it's completely invisible in the finished product.  Selah.  Did I mention that I got paid for that earlier this week?  My first paid writing in 4 years.  Yeah, this has been a fine and rewarding career choice.
