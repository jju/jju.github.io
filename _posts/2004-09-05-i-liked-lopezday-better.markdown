I went to the church in Wanzhou today.  Even though it starts ungodly early.  Who goes places at 8:30am?  Other than school I guess.  So I haven't been able to sleep in which is starting to take its toll.  This afternoon was all about napping.  And I'm comfortable enough with my teaching routine that I don't mind not spending all my time prepping.
  

  
Anyway, the best part about church was this guy who got really angry and was heckling the deacons(?) when they were lining up to do the communion thing.  He was just yelling stuff, which was good 'cause it gave me something to focus on.  I understand why it was such a big deal when those crazy Protestants said, "Hey, let's do church in a language people can understand!"  I dozed and people-watched and wrote a bit.  In my first trip I didn't want to bring a book, but next time I will.
  

  
An English student named Aesion came over this afternoon and was telling me about a student in a university in Yunnan last year who killed his three dormmates and then fled to Guangdong.  It came up because Aesion was his classes propaganda officer last year.  So when that incident happened, Aesion had to draw pictures for the political meetings addressing how to keep tabs on students who might wig out.  It was very informative.
