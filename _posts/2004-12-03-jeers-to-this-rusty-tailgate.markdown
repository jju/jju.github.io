Three weeks from now you may all be having quality family time and eggnog and jiaozi and  such, but will you have 32 new books to read?  
  
When I got to Wanzhou I my boss in the States with a list of authors that our organizational library here was lacking.  He, being a great guy, went to book fairs and found cheap books by said authors to send me (plus others that might be good/useful).  
  
So I now have some Pynchon, scifi by people I like, Chekhov, and three(!) Kundera books (two of which I haven't read and the third is my favourite) here.  In fact, I've only read five of these books before.  
  
This should help get me through a few more months.  
  
Cheers to new books!
