I have no idea if it's a getting older thing or a China thing or just displaced book buying urges but I get way more excited about clothes here than I ever have before.
  

  
You may recall that I have problems finding plain shirts in Wanzhou.  Everything is either in the polo shirt style (which I loathe beyond comprehension) or it is covered in the kinds of pictures of skateboarders and basketball players and writing I would have thought was supercool when I was 10.
  

  
But yesterday I bought a long sleeved Tshirt and a sweater at a place called Semir.  The shirt is mostly black and the writing on it is subtle enough that I can deal with it (I still might try scraping it off).  The sweater though.  Oh how I love the sweater (after I cut off the shield-like badge it originally had on the chest).
  

  
It's an orange sweater, and looks like something I'd have found at the Mulvey Market (represent!).  But the important thing is how it makes me feel like I should start up a geeky indie rock band.  I've been listening to Weezer and the Weakerthans all afternoon.  I realize Weezer is by no means indie.  Shut up.
  

  
So if you're in the Wanzhou area and want to teach me three chords, or will let me be the sensitive bass player let me know.
