54/53 (I'm not sure what time it is)
  

  
Today at work while I was painting trim on my boss' garage, I started working out a setting and lead character for a comic.  Main inspirations include Planetary, Run Lola Run, Over the Edge, and a bit of Batman (more for colours than anything else).  Now I want to learn something about comic script formatting so I can take my notes and start vaguely cobbling something together.
  

  
I lost my little black notebook that I've had in my pocket for the last 2-3 years, along with my good black pen.  I remember using them both at Folk Fest, and haven't seen them since, so if anyone found such an item, please let me know so I can get it back.  It's only three or four pages from being completely full, and I would have liked to be able to toss it in a drawer somewhere so I could find it someday and marvel at its fragmented documentation of this era of my life.  But if it's gone then I won't be able to.  Selah.
