Paul Pope made this near future sf comic called [100%](http://www.amazon.ca/100%25-HC-Paul-Pope/dp/1401221335/). I think the only other Paul Pope book I'd read was his [Batman: Year 100](http://www.amazon.ca/Batman-Year-100-Paul-Pope/dp/1845764242/) which was seven kinds of awesome. The most science fictional part of it is that the strippers digitally display their guts, get way down below the skin. Storywise it's a few interconnected stories of the kind you'd see in an indie movie. There's a boxer and a stripper and a dishwasher and an artist and it's just a barely connected story of these people and it's great. Nothing you haven't seen before, but it's all done well.
