We tried watching a DVD tonight. None of us had heard of the movie before.  The cover said Tiptoes with Matthew McConaghey.  The blurb on the back talked about a human trafficking ring.    It sounded interesting.  It was a comedy about little people.  About twenty minutes in Holly and Margie decided that we didn't need to finish it.  If it had turned into a story of human trafficking it would have been the most surreal one ever.  I really hoped that was what it was going to do, but realized it probably wouldn't.  I hadn't looked at the package before, but afterwards I examined it and the back of the package had pictures and the credits from Mean Girls.  So three separate components to the packaging.  Any one of which could have been correct.
