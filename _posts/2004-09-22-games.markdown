I've been having far too much fun playing with flickr in the past couple of days.  I'm going to upload some of my pictures from my trip with Reyn too.  But I'll shut up about it now.  
  
The other thing I've found is a place to play [Cosmic Encounter](http://www.cosmicencounter.com/screens/home.html) online.  It's one of those wicked cool Settlers-like boardgames that I'd never gotten a chance to try.  But I can see how it'd rock.  
  
Adi is kind of our liaison in the Foreign Language Department and she sat in on a class today.  I hate that.  I start feeling all defensive about how it's going.  She talked to me afterwards and didn't get mad at me but asked if I'd play on the English Department's basketball team and gave me a pin that I'm supposed to wear to signify that I'm a teacher (I think).  Although I'm pretty sure that everyone knows who the white guy on campus is.
