A woman came to the desk today to tell us that she couldn't watch Under the Tuscan Sun when she took it out because there was no video. "That's strange," said Lynne. "What happened?"

"There's just a black screen. And it's a new DVD player so that can't be the problem. But this is the second time it's happened. Do you think those thieves got on there?"

"Thieves?"

"Yes, the video thieves," she said, completely serious. "Can they do that nowadays? Just steal the video right off the disc leaving nothing behind for the rest of us?"

Happily the woman had time for Lynne to grab the "video-stolen" DVD from downstairs and test it on our player to show the woman that the video was on the disc and no one had stolen it. She seemed positively baffled that the disc still had video. "That wasn't there! I didn't see any of this."

Our staff was very good about it, explaining that maybe the three second pause before the video started hung up the disc somehow on her machine. She took a different copy (after testing it and seeing that the video had not been stolen) home with her. I really hope it worked.
