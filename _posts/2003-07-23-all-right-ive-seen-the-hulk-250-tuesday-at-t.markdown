All right.  I've seen The Hulk ($2.50 tuesday at the cheap theatre on campus).  There was some really cool stuff to it.  A lot of supersweet transitions instead of standard cuts and wipes.  In fact, they were my favourite parts of the movie.  The Hulk looked good in CGI.  There were a couple of moments he didn't, but compared to Daredevil or Spiderman those moments were negligible.  The opening credits were very sexy.  One of my only out loud comments while watching (I'd promised the people I was with that I wouldn't go on about things while the movie was going) was after those credits: "Now that's science!"
  

  
Storywise it was shitty.  Barring any comicbook geekery about gamma radiation being good enough for Stan Lee, the whole repressed memory thing fucked the story's structure incredibly.  Because we're dealing with memory we have to experience a gap.  Because we need to experience that gap we can't just go back to young Bruce Banner in flashbacks (since flashbacks are arbitrary in what they show, we wouldn't find a gap odd).  Because of that the entire first chunk of the movie takes forever.  Because the first chunk takes forever, the last bit has to go so fast it's almost unintelligible.  Also, the split screening was really cool, but it was just cool for coolness sake and didn't give us any more information.  I think the main problem there was that the story (which was simple to the extreme) didn't have that much information to convey, so showing three angles of a switch being flicked didn't advance anything.  What I would have loved to see was that kind of split screening (and those sexy transitions) in X2, where they could have been used to look cool and give the audience more info, since it had a lot to give.  I was just disappointed that they couldn't do any more with that.   Also, there was none of the self deprecating fun that XMen (1&2), or Spiderman, or Daredevil had, which was kind of disappointing.
  

  
Strangely enough, I was the person I saw it with who seemed to like it the least.  It may have just been an expectation thing.  I wanted Ang Lee to make this great.  And it wasn't great.  The rest of the people I was with thought it would be pretty crappy, and they found it was better than that.
