Speaking of people who aren't journalists despite having their MA's in such a field: Here's a [Sunshine Girl](http://www.torontosun.com/SUNshineGirl/Thursday/home.html) I went to school with (the link will point to someone else by Thursday) [UPDATE: the link no longer points to Angela Smith.  I no longer know the person on the other end].  I don't know if I should be laughing at her when my own journalistic credibility is so negligible but I will.   
  
Thanks to Tait for seeing this and Suzanne for sending me the link.
