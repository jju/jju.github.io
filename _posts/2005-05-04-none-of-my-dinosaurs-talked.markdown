Last night we had pretty much continuous lightning from 11:30pm till sometime past 2am when I finally fell asleep.  Twas awesome.
  

  
I flipped over so my head was at the foot of the bed and I could look out the window.  The lightning wasn't forking anywhere I could see, and the mountain sort of blocks a lot of the view but I watched it for hours.  And thought about having [a meaningful life](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=534).
