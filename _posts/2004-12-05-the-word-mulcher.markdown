I don't really care about Iris Murdoch but this story about how [one of her novels may be evidence of Alzheimer's](http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2004/12/02/Arts/IrisMurdoch041202.html) was too close to the machine in [If On A Winter's Night A Traveller . . .](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156439611/102-8650276-4656102?v=glance) for me not to comment on it.
