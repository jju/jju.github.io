I wonder sometimes why I try to write fiction.  I'm not one of those people who needs to do it or go insane.  What I hate though is looking over what I've written and seeing it filled with boring crappy words instead of wowee popping great words.  And recently when I've hit the Ugh I hate describing things stage my mind has turned to comics and how then the only words people will see is the dialogue.  I can sometimes write snappy dialogue.  It's much easier for me to write in the way a person talks (or at least an affected version of same) so dialogue is the shit I love doing.  
  
This all comes up because I went back to a story I've been working on and it's just bothering me.  It would be so much easier to do it as a script.  Apart from all that getting an artist stuff.  I got so pissed off at that story today I could only write a couple of pages in it before I went to sketch out another Machine of Death submission involving a gunrunner in undisclosed Asian mountains.  
  
Oh, I've also updated the [Stacksburg blog](http://stacksburg.blogspot.com) with Saturday's happenings, including a few pictures.
