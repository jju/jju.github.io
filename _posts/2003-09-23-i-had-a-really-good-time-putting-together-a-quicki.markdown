I had a really good time putting together a quickie TV piece yesterday, though.  We'd planned it out on Friday so it was a matter of putting the pictures together and laying in the voice over which we wrote afterwards.  It's great seeing these things take shape.  That story wasn't hugely substantial, but you know what?  I'm not either.  In my media and politics class today our prof (Michael Nolan) was explaining how the medium a person works in has to be an extension of her personality.  He was applying it to politicians and how they have to work the camera (and how they had to work the radio) but it also works for us journos.  So maybe my personality just fits a bit better with TV than a daily paper.  Who'd have thunk it?
