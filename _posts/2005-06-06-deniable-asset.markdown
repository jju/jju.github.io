Fun thing I learned:  We weren't supposed to be taking pictures at the dam on Friday and I've been asked to delete any that I have (by Miss Hu; I don't know exactly who asked her).
  

  
At the time I was impressed that no one seemed to care about Miss Hu and I snapping away.  I get a little paranoid about what I am allowed to photograph here so it was pretty nice.  And then the omnipresent state makes itself known again.
  

  
So THEY'VE BEEN DELETED (he says loudly to emphasize to the internet police that he's a good little communist).  And it is entirely coincidental if players in any of my future games of Godlike get their hands on remarkably authentic spy-type documents.
