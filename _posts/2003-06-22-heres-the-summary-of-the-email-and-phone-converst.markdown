Here's the summary of the email and phone conversation that I had with my mom over a few days:

J - I hate talking to people I don't know.

M - You talked to Knowlton Nash.

J - Because there was an open bar and we had a shmoozy classmate along.

M - Well maybe you should just have a couple of drinks before you have to talk to anyone.

J - I'm going to have to talk to people all the time.  Wouldn't that be kind of bad?

M - Well, sort of. Maybe you should just be a working alcoholic.

We went to Stratford for a play today.  Taming of the Shrew is a FUCKED UP tale of destroying a person.  All I knew about it going in was that it was one of Shakespeare's comedies, so I shouldn't expect everyone to die by the end.  But because of the whole comedy aspect I wasn't worried through the last bit, because the most celebrated writer in history was going to pull off something that would make it funny rather than vile.  No.  They played the ending straight.  Joy (an English major) told me that it's possible to do the ending with so much irony it leaves the crowd dripping (like John the Baptist), but they didn't.  It's like if From Justin to Kelly had the ending from Requiem For A Dream.  It was confusing as hell.
