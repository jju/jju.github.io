I've done some of the touristy things now.  Two.  Tian An Men Square (where I refused to eat at the McDonald's) and the Forbidden City, the city of the emperors, the city of a thousand riches (that were carried off to Taiwan), the city with Mao's portrait out on the front wall.  Everything I know about the Forbidden City I learned from 007.  I rented the audio guide which is narrated in English by Roger Moore.  It was surprisingly good.
  

  
We also went to Beijing's biggest church on Sunday.  It was amazing to see a woman praying in the same voice that if she had been born 30 years earlier would have been used to denounce her teacher or neighbour or coworker.  It's an oracular style that scares me.  And the hasty Amens following her phrases.  I just felt through the whole thing how it doesn't matter what it's called, but people have to believe and make speeches about how much they believe.  Agh.
  

  
There's a specific order that you have to do do the strokes in when you write Chinese characters.  Your teacher gets very distraught if you ask why that's the best way and why does she tell us rules and then break them right away and what's the difference anyway once it's on the page?  Just be quiet and listen.
