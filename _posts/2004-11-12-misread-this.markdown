I was just reading this Alternet article, [War on Iraq: Misreading Islam](http://alternet.org/waroniraq/20488/).  It talks about Bernard Lewis and how his analysis of the arab world has been very influential and very wrong.
  

  
I read my first Bernard Lewis book a few months ago in Beijing.  It was there in the CEE library for any of us to take along with us.  When I read it I didn't agree with its premise but couldn't say why.  
  

  
I find that happens a lot here.  I can't find a good reason for any of my opinions.  I mean, I can look things up on the net to find counter examples if I'm forced to but most of the time I don't bother.  It's part of this bigger thing about lying politely all the time.  Like saying I like basketball when I don't.  It's just so much easier to not argue with someone who won't understand you anyway.  So much easier to say the standard expected thing.  To answer in a politically correct kind of way.
  

  
Part of this is because I realize I'm in a vulnerable position here.  Margie has told me about what has happened when she's made comments about Taiwan.  People are always paying attention to what you say and what you look at and what you care about.  And if you say the wrong thing people will find out.
  

  
I miss saying what I want to say with people I don't have to worry about offending.
