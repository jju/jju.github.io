If only I'd found [this article](http://alternet.org/story/20844/) before giving my Christmas classes today: 

<blockquote>"There is a beautiful spiritual message underlying Christmas that has universal appeal: the hope that gets reborn in moments of despair, the light that gets re-lit in the darkest moments of the year, is beautifully symbolized by the story of a child born of a teenage homeless mother who had to give birth in a manger because no one would give her shelter, and escaping the cruelty of Roman imperial rule and its local surrogate Herod who already knew that such a child would grow up to challenge the entire imperialist system."</blockquote>

It just kind of puts that Christmas idea into words I could use to talk about the christmas story without feeling like a goddamned evangelist.  Though I did talk a bunch about how the spirit of Christmas is about giving not getting yadda yadda yadda, and talked about charities and things.  So it wasn't all Santa.
  

  
Speaking of which I think I might have offended a student.  Kim is a big boy.  Easily a pre-vegan Sean weight but shorter than me.  Very round.  He was in class at the beginning, and I think he was still there early on, but soon after I drew a picture of Santa and explained that he's traditionally a big fat man, I didn't see Kim any more.  He didn't come back after the break either.  So he might have just skipped out on unrelated matters, but I can't help wondering if I shouldn't have called Santa fat.  But that's stupid.  Santa is a fat man.  Students need to know he's fat if they want to know about english culture.
  

  
Yeah I don't need a million "Actually, in Estonia, Santa is strapped to a table 11 months of the year and survives on licking the bugs off his reindeer until he works himself to death in December so he's actually quite svelte" kind of exceptions.  Santa's a fat bastard.  Deal with it.
