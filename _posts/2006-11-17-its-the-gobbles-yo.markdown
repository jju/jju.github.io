Have I mentioned how closely my life mimics that of a certain [clip-art dinosaur](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=884)?  
  
Last night I was walking home from Reyn's and it was wow crazy nice out.  There was this crust of snowy ice on the sidewalk that I actually had traction on (unlike those glistening curbs) and the temperature was mildly invigorating.  As in invigorating because it was so mild, which isn't a word you usually associate with mild, but we will just for today.  
  
Anyway, this thin layer of snow was hard enough that I didn't leave any footprints.  I mean, there were faint traces of the treads of my runners, but nothing that, at a glance, would tell you someone had just walked by.  There were other footprints, just not mine.  
  
Now to think up a new catch-phrase.  Survey says it won't be "Dirty" though it may be dirty.  (Who am I trying to kid?  I'll want to tell my mom my catch-phrase, so it won't even be dirty.)
