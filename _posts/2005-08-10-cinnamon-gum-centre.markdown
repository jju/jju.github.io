_[This post was written earlier this week but Blogger seemed not to want to publish it. 8/14/05]_

One of the great things about Beijing is that there are cool Chinese people here.  It's what happens when you live in one of the country's major centres I guess.  I always forget about this because out in Wanzhou the really cool people are few and far between.  Because they generally don't want to hang out in the sticks and head for a place they can congregate.

On Monday our teacher took our class out to this artsy district (DaShanZi) that was filled with old factories that had been turned into little art galleries.  Some were also artist's studios, like this one guy who was doing big canvases of white on white paintings that were all about the texture.  But there were posh little places with anti Party style art (pantsless babies in mao jackets saluting faceless baby mobs with their fists in the air) and cramped little places with dancing girl sculptures that looked like they were made from buildings, and a superb photography gallery.

The best piece I saw was a matched pair of metre - metre and a half across woodcut things.  One was a red star on a black square and the other was a black star on red square.  These are the big five pointed communist stars (or at least what I think of as communist stars).  The awesome thing was that the red parts on both of them were smooth spray-painted wood, but the black parts (so the background on one and the star on the other) was made out of the woodcuts used for printing Tibetan prayer books.  I've never wanted to be really rich more than at that moment. I just wanted to drop an exorbitant amount of money for them without batting an eye.

On Friday I'm probably heading back to one place that did funky one-off clothes to buy a ridiculously expensive jacket (but one I can afford, hopefully).
