A week from right now I'll be hurtling eastward.  I've started packing sort of, and am having great difficulties deciding which books are coming with me.  6 shelves worth is what I'm limiting myself to.  That includes all my HST stuff, my Haruki Murakami, a smattering of Hemingway, the Transmetro stack, rulebooks for 4 different RPGs plus assorted setting material, Pynchon makes an appearance, and just to give the impression that I am going to fakeLondon for school I even tucked in some anthropology texts that might be useful.  Notably absent: Salman Rushdie and any Dostoevsky (sorry, I lie; I have a D-man short story collection).  It's weird because I know I'd actually use far more books than I'm bringing, but we are only using a Civic to haul all my stuff out.  Selah.
