Now I'm not Hassie in the whole professional "The design of this thing is so terrible!" kind of way. But MCC is so screwed up in the way they try to keep you from contacting any real people through the internet. If you don't already know the person's email address there's no way to find it. Not even when the person is the head of a Peace Development division that has [its own website](http://iamrevolting.org) (but no way to contact anyone! Gah!).

[UPDATE: I found the email address of someone in the Peace section of MCC, but not the person I'm looking for. So there is a way to contact someone for the stupidly persistent. I've sent an email to MCC Canada to get them to forward it on, but it's still just stupid.]
