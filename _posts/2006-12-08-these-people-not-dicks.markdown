I just got this in my email.  It's a statement by those CPTers who were kidnapped last year in Iraq, the kind of people that don't make me cringe about having religious commonalities with.

<blockquote>We unconditionally forgive our captors for abducting and holding us.  We have no desire to punish them.  Punishment can never restore what was taken from us.  
  
What our captors did was wrong.  They caused us, our families and our friends great suffering.  Yet, we bear no malice towards them and have no wish for retribution.  Should those who have been charged with holding us hostage be brought to trial and convicted, we ask that they be granted all possible leniency.  We categorically lay aside any rights we may have over them.  
  
Forgiveness is an essential part of Sikh, Christian and Muslim teaching. Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first of the Sikh Gurus said, "'Forgiveness' is my mother..." and, "Where there is forgiveness, there is God."  Jesus said, "For if you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."  And of Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) it is told that once, while preaching in the city of Ta'if, he was abused, stoned and driven out of the city.  An angel appeared to him and offered to crush the city between the two surrounding mountains if he ordered him to do so, whereupon the prophet (or Mohammed PBUH) said,  "No.  Maybe from them or their offspring will come good deeds."</blockquote>

You might want to read [the whole statement (and more)](http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_06128kember.shtml).  
  
Completely unrelated to that, I love how Jon Stewart refers to Donald Rumsfeld as being "dickish."
