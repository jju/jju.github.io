I went out for dinner with Eric, a teacher in the Computer Science department who's working on his English so he can get into grad school.  I don't know what is with Chinese people who take me places, but they never know how to get back from wherever we go (Holly excepted - she had problems getting to where we were going).  We tried three different places to catch the bus back before finding the right one.
  

  
We had a "roasted fish" in a part of Wanzhou I'd never been to and when we walked around the square after dinner a little guy asked us to help him translate his mixing board.  He worked in the Min Tian International Exhibition hall where they'd gotten a new Topaz mixer for the theatre.  All the labels were in English though.  So Eric and I wrote down the translations for Gain, Pan, Input, Output, Solo and Mute and things like that.  Who says my radio training is useless out here?
