[RAW Documentary - Guerrilla Words](http://www.fims.uwo.ca/radio/newraw/documentaries/documentaries.htm#justin)

This is my radio documentary.  Listen.  I liked it.

I am done done done.  Going to TO for a baseball game this weekend, then to Montreal next weekend then back to Peg City.  Good times.

Oh, and [THIS](http://www.fims.uwo.ca/radio/newraw/documentaries/sound/notablooperreel.ram) is not a radio blooper reel.
