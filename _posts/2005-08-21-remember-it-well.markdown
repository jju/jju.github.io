I believe it has finally stopped raining.  What's up with this place?  I thought this was supposed to be one of the furnaces of China.  I can't remember if it was this crappy last year at this time because I was too busy freaking out about having to teach right away.  I don't know yet when I have to teach this year.  Not tomorrow.  Most likely next week.  
  

  
Now to see what new buildings have been constructed downtown in my absence.
