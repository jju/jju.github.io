In the last couple of days I downloaded (legally) a bunch of Canadian hiphop I was pointed to by the [radio3](http://radio3.cbc.ca) podcast.  Even though Wordburglar rhymed "Barrymore" with "Carey more" for the best lyric Bucky, I still like his stuff.  Cadence Weapon gets a little serious for my taste, but still, he'll play.  And I love Hunnicut's bit about Prince in the Farm Fresh song "30 in the Club."    
  
You know who else I like?  Kid Koala.  He's coming to Winnipeg on January 23rd.  I will be there.  I think that might be the same day as Snoop Dogg, but it was an easy choice for me to make.  A babyfaced turntablist/author of the best robot love story ever versus the man who brought us "bizzack" and "shizzle"?
