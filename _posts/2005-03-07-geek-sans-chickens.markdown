When I was in Hong Kong I bought [Exalted](http://www.white-wolf.com/exalted/index.php?line=intro), my first RPG purchase in many months (not counting the things I got my mom to pick up for me but that I won't see till I go back).  Today I finally got down to reading it and I can see why there are so many screaming fanboys on [RPG.net](http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=3).  It seems like a really quite excellent fantasy setting.  I'd probably use a different system to simplify it a bunch, and it'll never take [Unknown Armies'](http://unknown-armies.com) place as my game of choice but it looks fun.

Man do I wish I had people to play games with here.
