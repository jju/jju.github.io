Instead of posting anything yesterday I read comics.  And worked very hard.  Feel sorry for me.  
  
Anyway, I've been working through the archives for [Achewood](http://www.achewood.com) and it is amazing.  All of life is captured in the lives of these animals.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10082002) is a bachelor party.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12132002) is the road trip / Folk Fest experience.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=05212004) is television.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07172003) is life in foreign lands.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10272003) is growing up in West Virginia.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06052003) is being a blogger.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=10172003) is having annoying food preferences.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06232003) is golf (and also your brain on drugs, but mostly golf).  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=12302003) is childhood trauma.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=02272003) is tax-time.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=06172003) is love.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=03242004) is religion.  
  
[This](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=04252003) is why I actually came to China. (Not really, but his diary entry reminds me of how Reyn writes.)  
  
So good.
