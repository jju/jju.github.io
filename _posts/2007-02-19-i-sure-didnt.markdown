Who knew that Pushkin wrote poems about holding a midget in a bag and forcing it to roar like a lion to scare off the herd of oxen that had been sent to gore you?  Did you?  But it happens in [Ruslan and Ludmila](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174174/).  The midget in question has an extremely long beard (as in he has attendants carry it for him) which is the source of his power.  
  
That's been two crazy Russian fantastika films in as many nights.  And it makes me want to write something crazy in that vein.  But not tomorrow.  Tomorrow I am a "young prophet."  And will probably do a bit of painting.
