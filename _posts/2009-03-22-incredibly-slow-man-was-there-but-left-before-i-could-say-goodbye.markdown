And I'm done taking the bus to Logan and Keewatin then walking for forever. The next time I go to work I leave half an hour before I'm scheduled to start.

On my last day at Intrepid I was pleased to have a pointless stupid task meant to clean up stuff Targ is incapable of doing. It fit somehow. She made a horrible gigantic printout of an unlicensed Inspector Clouseau cartoon image and then managed to lose a third of his face while putting the papers together. When I pointed out that Clouseau usually has a moustache she said she could still salvage it maybe by colouring one on. And Vina shuddered. And pointed out that people take pictures of the Summer Reading displays so maybe having it look like a pile of ass tacked to a wall might not be a good idea. 

Now, Targ had taped her Clouseau together from the front, so when I removed the tape to find his face it pulled off layers of paper, making a patchy horrid mess. I pointed this out to her and she said she'd colour over it and I should try salvaging the thing. And Vina wept.

So I kept on doing this task, making something I could in no conscience hang on a wall, happy in my knowledge I'll never have to deal with it again. Then Targ finally decided that maybe the battered wounded (illegal) poster might not be so great so could I please make her a new one? She didn't know where she found the image and didn't save it anywhere. I told her a new one would be a good idea and she found her image and I printed off the pages. Now she was trying to get Ivy to teach Sofia (my replacement) how to build the poster tomorrow, but Ivy would have none of it, since that's the kind of bullshit Targ does: make everyone else do her work. (I sent Sofia an email explaining how she might want to get her duties formalized before Targ commandeers her every work-bound moment with Targ's crap.)

Now I have a Sunday off (my first in seeming forever) before starting in at the nuthouse (Section 22) on Monday.
