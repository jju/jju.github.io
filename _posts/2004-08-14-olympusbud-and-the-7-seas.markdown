So this morning I got up to go down to Zhongguancun, the technology haven in Beijing to get a camera.  Why do that when I have a perfectly good digital camera?  Well firstly you shouldn't ask so many questions and secondly I am now the official photographer for my organization that shall remain nameless.  Not that being the photog really means much since everyone has a camera anyway, but I've now got an aura of respectability to wear when I'm taking pictures.  Sadly, my previous camera was not up to the strict requirements of this new position, so I got one that is a little more work and a little less point-and-shoot.  I like it.  My old one still has more space for pictures on it, which was important as my travelling camera with Reyn, and it has done very well for itself.

I got on the bus this morning to go and get a camera.  After getting onto the bus and finding a conductor to pay her the 1 kuai (about $0.17) I found a space to stand and started looking out the window.  And the bus didn't move.  First, a word about buses with conductors: I love 'em.  They remind me of pirate ships, like we're sailing the seas and the members of the crew all have their jobs so the captain can get us through the storms of traffic.  I always wish they would say more "Avast ye hearties" and make people walk planks to disembark.  Back to the becalmed bus.

Now this is one of those articulated buses (which I'm told must be a Canadianism since the Americans call them worm buses - in any case the bus has two parts with an accordionlike swivelling connection) but it is old.  It reminds me of India, this bus, though it isn't so crowded.  It's patched and discoloured and the seats make you think of when you had your last tetanus shot.

It could have been stopped because it was ahead of schedule or something so I wasn't worried, but some people started looking around and being generally disgruntled.  Then the two conductors said something and a pile of people got off the bus.  Some people stayed on though, so I did too, having no idea what was going on and not really wanting to be left behind.

From my spot near the back I saw the conductors (two twenty-something females) leading a pile of commuters in their shoving of the bus.  "Heave ho!" they shouted in my head and then the engine caught and the bus started again and everyone got back on and we were back on our way (to find some booty - sweet sweet pirate booty).
