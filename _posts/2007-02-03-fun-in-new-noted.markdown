Here's the best thing about the library:

<blockquote>A dialogue in two parts (featuring an old guy in a beard and an old guy in a hat)  
  
Beard: "... but sometimes I just sing out."  
Hat: "What do you mean you sing out?"  
Beard: "In my heart.  Where do you sing out?"  
Hat: "I don't know if I do."  
  
Later these guys were arguing over whether they were arguing or just sharing their opinions.  That wrapped up amicably with the following exchange.  
  
Hat: "You know, you're going to make it to the kingdom of heaven before me."  
Beard: "What are you talking about?"  
Hat: "The kingdom of heaven.  You'll get there before me."  
Beard: "Why?"  
Hat: "Because you're a better person than me."  
Beard: "How can you say that?"</blockquote>

The other day when I was wearing my red [T-Rex](http://www.qwantz.com/) shirt a woman came up to me asking why lawyers don't wear red and followed up with the following monologue before wandering off. "What would you have to do to have a lawyer for a friend? It must be nice.  Don't worry dinosaur, humans won't be around forever.  All the people will end up like you someday."
