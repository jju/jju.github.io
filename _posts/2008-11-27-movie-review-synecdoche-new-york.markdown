I saw [Synecdoche, New York (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383028/) on Monday at the Globe. I must admit that though I've been waiting for this one to show up in Winnipeg I've been mispronouncing the title for weeks (in my head), depriving me of the pun. It seems to be my fate to always read the letters che as a sh sound. When the words come from the Greek instead of the French that is incorrect. Beyond my ignorance on pronunciation the movie didn't disappoint. Well, the absence of Catherine Keener for most of the film was a bit disappointing, but I loved the way time went and the circular stuff that happened and the absurdity and the deathbed scenes and the doubling trebling of everything. Philip Seymour Hoffman was so good, so painful to watch. Great movie. Weird and awesome and true.
