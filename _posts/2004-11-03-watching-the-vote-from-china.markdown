A fun way to watch election coverage is to use the audio from CBC and muted video from CCTV.  Sometimes they even sync up.  
  
And I must say, I like the timezone delay.  I could wake up leisurely put the last of my British Culture midterm marks onto the computer and then start paying attention.  None of this "I should go to bed" namby-pambiness.  
  
Supposedly NBC declared Kerry won about 20 minutes ago.  I'm pretty surprised that a network would do that without having results from Ohio or Florida.  Ah scoopiness.
