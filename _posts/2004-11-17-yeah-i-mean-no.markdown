I just did my lecture on hockey and Canadian culture.  So there are a couple of hundred Chinese people who believe that every Canadian is rabidly passionate about this sport, that Paul Henderson shrines are to be found in every home, that we will jersey people at a moment's notice.  Oh yeah, I used the big brush.  They gave me a bottle of water.  I acted out good hits and bad hits and told them of the wondrous nature of Jarome Iginla.   It was fun.  
  
And what's waiting for me when I get back?  William Shatner's new Ben Folds produced album, Has Been.  I love the Intertron.
