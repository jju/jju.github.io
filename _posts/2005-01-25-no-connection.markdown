I wasn't aware that this had been published yet, but I wrote a thing called [Clearly Screaming Shoes](http://www.chinaeducationalexchange.org/whats-happening-story-2.htm) to answer that perennial question: should tulips be planted on the north or south side of a Canadian house?

I'll put a version up here in the journalism section before I head for Hong Kong.  But right now I'm hungry for non organny meat.  I think what I had yesterday was stomach but I'm not sure.
