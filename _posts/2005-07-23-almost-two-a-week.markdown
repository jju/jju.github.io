So Yanji turned into one big laziness fest.  Theresa's apartment was really nice and we spent a lot of time just kicking back and enjoying the niceness.  And the gooseberries!  Holly made pancakes to celebrate the gooseberries.  I made cookies to celbrate having the ability to make cookies.  Then Holly made banana bread for fun.  
  
Holly and Theresa did a bunch of sauna and manicure-ish kinds of things while I contented myself with eating Korean food and gazing into North Korea.  We didn't go to the tourist crossing where you can supposedly get illegal Kim Jong Il pins.  Instead we went to this scenic point (which wasn't) but where you were standing in China and on one side was North Korea and on the other side was Russia.  It was weird because you could kind of see the differences.  I'm probably just imagining it, but Russia seemed flat, the DPRK was just dirt roads and barren hills, and China was the lushly forested land of opportunity.  That feeling was weird enough to be worth going out there for.  There's a river between China and North Korea.  China has watchtowers but I couldn't see any on the other side.  I guess the only people trying to get into North Korea are in Tom Clancy novels.  
  
We had sushi the night before we left Yanji.  I missed sushi.  This time in Beijing I'm goint to take advantage of it.  I'll treat myself to things like Starbucks and Mexican food.  
  
It's kind of sad to be in Beijing, because it means our travelling is now over.  Holly was great to travel with and we both had an excellent time.  We spent about 120 hours on trains.  5 full days.  
  
Today marks my one year in China anniversary.  I've read 103 books and learned about as many characters.
