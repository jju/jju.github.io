Tonight around 6:30pm there was the most wonderful power outage in the little block of restaurants by the college.    
  
Every restaurant around here is a variation on the "white room with bright flourescent lights and a blaring TV" theme.  The main difference is the tables and chairs.  Some are yellow and others have blue trim.    
  
But with the power out, all of these places were suddenly filled with slowly flickering yellow light.  There was no electric buzz and you could hear people talk as they hunched close to the light.  
  
I took complete advantage of the situation and since most food is cooked on gas (or at least whatever I order is) it didn't affect my meal. I revelled in how it felt like I was somewhere beautiful.  
  
The overhead lights eventually did come on and the candles were whisked away.  There were a few noises of delight outside but they didn't seem genuine.  The TVs returned to blaring, and I'd finished eating so I left.  
  
And it fit that I'd been reading Paul Bowles romanticize his laments over the loss of old things in strange lands.
