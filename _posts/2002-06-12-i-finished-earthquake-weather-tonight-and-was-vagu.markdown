I finished Earthquake Weather tonight and was vaguely disappointed.  It didn't have Last Call's oomph.  Neither did Expiration Date, but it had Edison.  On the plus side there was a Dionysian hunt that turned into a Bacchanalian revel at the end.  So now I go back to Fitzgerald and This Side of Paradise, which I'm not exactly jizzing myself over either.  Next week when I get paid, I'm picking up either a HST collection or something by Kesey, unless I get any really good suggestions.  I'm looking for something really snazzy.
