I'm heading off to scenic Gippsland, Victoria tomorrow for some Koha training. I was talking to [Sean](http://twitter.com/spgiesbrecht) the other day about how weird small businesses are. I mean, these librarians are paying for me to go out and teach them about this software I've only been using since April. I feel like at a lot of places I'd have needed more training than I have had (which is actually pretty extensive since I'm helping people with their Koha problems all day). Whatever works, I guess. And it means I get to see more of Oz while I'm here.

I've been pretty bad about going out to see stuff recently. A lot of hunkering down here in front of the internet. My friend [Jamie](http://twitter.com/fongolia) is off to do his practicum in London (the real one) and got scolded by another of our classmates for [solving internet puzzles](http://www.themastertheorem.com/) while he's supposed to be on vacation. But dude, I completely get that. I've been spending far too much time planning out Blood Bowl teams (speaking of which, I found an unofficial Blood Bowl client for playing online which almost works completely well apart from me not being able to simply stand up prone players - let me know if you're interested in playing).

Of course, a week from today all of that will change since that's when [Holly](http://twitter.com/hollyrinny) arrives from China. I'll engage in a tiny bit of understatement to say I'm looking forward to being in the same city as her, especially without an end-date.

Finally, if you miss my voice, you can now [listen to me read Firing Squad](http://machineofdeath.net/pod-squad), my [Machine of Death](http://machineofdeath.net) story whenever you want. Though the magic of reading (and recording) it's my voice without my innumerable hesitations, filler words and false starts that litter my real speech pattern, so it's probably more pleasurable in every possible way. You can pump that story through your speakers and pity the poor shmucks who have to deal with me speaking without a script at them.

Like the librarians in Gippsdale next week.
