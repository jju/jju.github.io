I've secured a lease on an apartment for Madame Holly and myself. And because of that I think I'm going to be able to start enjoying Sydney again. I'm not the kind of person who can relax and have fun with a big unresolved issue looming. On Monday though, I'll move in and that'll be a lot of worrying off of me.

In preparation for moving in, and because I'm going to be spending more time hanging out at Prosentient (but not working), I switched hostels today. The place I'd been at was out in Potts Point, near the King's Cross subway stop, which was a longer trip into Ultimo than I would have liked. 

I stayed at the Blue Parrot on John's recommendation and I have to follow up with him about why he thought it was so great. Not that it was bad. It just didn't generate any great allegiance in me. Most likely that's because I didn't really participate in the hostel-bonding experiences of drinking at whatever local bar dressed up as a national stereotype or dressed as a lady for free drinks or whatever. 

The Blue Parrot staff were more friendly there than at the Sydney Central YHA where I am now, which is a much more professionalized hotel-like hostel (that charges for WiFi - boofuckingurns). But they also had terrible radio stations blaring in the kitchen all day long.

Enough about hostels.

Saturday was Free Comic Book Day and I went to a couple of places to see what was happening. Kings Comics had a 20% off sale (50% off back issues) plus the aforementioned free comic books. I picked up the paperback edition of Jimmy Corrigan the Smartest Kid on Earth and managed to refrain from buying anything else. This was kind of a big deal for me. I learned I'm actually two trades behind on DMZ and it took so much not to complete that collection. But something like that would have to come back to Canada with me to be fully useful. Jimmy Corrigan I can read here and possibly get Holly to read because it's awesome, and if we don't have room to bring it back to Vancouver it would make an excellent gift.

I also went to a Kinokuniya Bookstore. I know I've read that name before but didn't know what kind of bookstore to expect. It was quite large and had a bunch of artists there for Free Comic Book Day, including a couple of indie zine-type self publishers. I bought a really cool black ink on black paper thing about Leviathan and Moby Dick and other fish. Once I get a few more zines and things the plan is to send them over to Caitlin at the Schulz.

Tonight I went for a walk around Darling Harbour, which reminded me of the Kowloon boardwalk where you look at Hong Kong Island (I think I've got those geographical references correct, but since I'm not paying for WiFi they are being written without fact-checking and I might forget to check this before posting it). The climate and general appearance of Sydney reminds me more of Los Angeles if LA was a walkable size. Despite the city's expense, I think I like it.
