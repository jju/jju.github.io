You're all reading [Holly's blog](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hollyrinny) about this trip too, right?  
  
Cause she mentions giving tourguides/info-givers the benefit of the doubt, which is something I can't do. I just don't trust these people who are out to help me.  But Holly is very patient with me getting impatient with them.  I know that this means I won't have the kind of neat experience that [Caroline](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com) just talked about having in Malaysia.  Which is kind of sad.
