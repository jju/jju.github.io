For me, Chongqing is all about old buildings nestled into the middle of skyscrapers and sculptures on the street.  Like that giant [Thumbs Up](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/621195/) I blogged from my last trip.  
  
On Sunday I went looking for the Karl Marx head but couldn't find it.  But I did find a bunch of western scientists, like Darwin here.  
  
Also in CQ this weekend there was a mobile phone festival, which I learned about on the English TV news.  Have I mentioned that we don't get the English channel here?  There were all these girls dressed up in shiny suits, some silver, some blue and some yellow.  The idea was that they walked around in a crowd to attract attention.  I loved the ones in yellow, and when a bunch stopped to eat some lunch I had to surreptitiously get [a picture](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/1777101/).
