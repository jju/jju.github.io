I think South of the Border, West of the Sun is not a bad book, but since it has a very low weirdness quotient, it has to be directly compared with Norwegian Wood, and there is no way that it can win that fight.  Just a random thought that don't connect at all with any comments anyone may have made in any previous post.
  

  
Watched Ang Lee's The Ice Storm the other day, and laughed because without even trying, I now have a hook to hang the LotR movies on without having to pick up Ronin.
