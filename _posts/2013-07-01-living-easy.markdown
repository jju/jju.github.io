This weekend has had a lot of music out in downtown, which I get to hear a lot of when my balcony door is open, which it has been. A band was playing Louie Louie last night and it didn't descend into a _C'thulhu ftagn_-spouting bacchanalia that ripped a hole in the fabric of reality itself, so in that one respect (along with so many others) fiction trumps reality.

This morning I biked out to the shore where the sculptures from this year's chainsaw carving competition stood. There was one that was very angular and looked like it'd been made out of metal then painted with a wood veneer. My favourite was of a spiky-mouthed sea monster emerging from the earth.

I stopped off afterwards at the Big Rock. I think that's what it's called. It's got an orca on it and is covered in graffiti. I sat by the water reading a bit. Because that is what one does.

After biking I rode my longboard down to the Canada Day festivities. Which were whatever. But I got a falafel from a truck and got to ride my board around a bit. I don't know if I've mentioned how much I like cruising around on that thing. I bike because it's a good way to get places. The actual process of biking doesn't usually give me pleasure. On a board maybe it's just the lower speeds, the subtle steering, the lack of extra equipment or the fact that I can hop off and walk at any moment, but it makes me happy.
