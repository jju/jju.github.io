It's funny how you forget about things that would have been weird once.  My friend [Caroline](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com) was writing about Beijing and mentioned a couple of things that I haven't.  
  
All the flowers outside here are in little pots, not flowerbeds.  It makes a lot of sense.  It's like little interchangeable lego bits.  And Caroline is right, there aren't many missing.  Maybe that'll be my next project to spruce up the old homestead.  
  
Here in Wanzhou I found a fishing shop.  I see people fishing off the bank of the river sometimes and can't imagine any fish in that water.  Like fishing the Ganges.  Maybe I'll give it a shot.  
  
Two days ago I watched pigs being unloaded from a boat at the port.  Pigs scream really loudly.  They were being carried out one by one, suspended from a pole by two guys.  As the guys would get their pig to the truck another pair of guys with a pig would be coming out of the boat so the pigscreams were constant.
