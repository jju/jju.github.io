[The Mystery of the Fool and the Vanisher](http://www.amazon.ca/Mystery-Fool-Vanisher-Ruth-Ellwand/dp/0763620963/) isn't much of a mystery but is super cool. The conceit of the book is that it's David Ellwand's journal from going out walking by a mound in England. There in a ruined house he finds a box. The box is full of stuff, including wax cylinders which he sends away to have put on CD. The middle part of the book is the transcription of those wax cylinders with pictures of the box's artifacts. The whole thing is beautiful, and is all about faerie and seeing things that aren't there and how it all relates to early photography. So neat. The story is fairly predictable but the pictures of all the items, including a tiny suit of armour made from mussel shells and the stone glasses and hat camera used to see the invisible, are wonderful.
