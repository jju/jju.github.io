Secret Tibetan Lubricant doesn't work as well as celebrities implied.


<blockquote>Beijing consumer Wang Litong: "It had no effect.  I did not have the oil expulsion nor the black oily feces that they advertised about."</blockquote>


Oily feces aside [this is an interesting article](http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20070320_1.htm) about the Chinese version of the FDA and how it approves advertising.  And the warnings to celebrities for endorsing things they don't understand.  Because of the infantilization of the Chinese consumer.  There's this undercurrent that any Chinese person will buy anything if there's a famous face on it.  I love the response of the celebrity Guo Degang at the end of the article

The other thing I found myself doing when I tagged it for del.icio.us was automatically using the censorship word.  Oh, habits when dealing with anything Chinese media-ish.
