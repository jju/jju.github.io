I got the cheque for my Machine for Death story today!  I went out and bought groceries and still have a shiny $20 bill in my pocket.  Woohoo for turning words into food and thence into poop.  
  
Today I also headed down to the CMU library to drop off a book I'd borrowed for research purposes.  And wandered through some bookstores without spending my shiny $20.  Amazing.
