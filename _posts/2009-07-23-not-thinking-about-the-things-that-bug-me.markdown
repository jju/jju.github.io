I finished scanning in the multilingual collection yesterday. After many weeks and inefficiencies. All the stuff could have been done with one pass through the section if it had been organized properly. But it wasn't. I shouldn't complain. I was getting paid for it and it's not like I had anything better to do.

Mary and I were talking about the weirdness of City work, and she mentioned how some day she'd kind of like to work in a private company, where trying to do things efficiently was something that might be rewarded instead of something you have to hide from your idiot superior who won't understand what's going on. I don't feel that strongly about it, but I bet that after a few more years here I might.

There were some good bits at the desk this week too. The stoned guy came by to thank me for my great insights on Shakespeare and Brave New World from a while back. "Yeah, a third way.. with the soma and passivity... yeah. I loved it. And what's this Oscar Wilde stuff like?" He recently bought a cassette player from Goodwill and has been taking out piles of classic literature audiobooks. Of course the cassette versions are abridged, but I don't think that matters much to him. I like him because he is always so impressed with everything. "You have Pete Seeger AND Bob Seger? That's incredible!"

Ashleigh was telling me how one of the homeless guys (let's call him Chesty LaRue for his open vest on bare pectoral/gut fashion choice) was marching around the main floor on Tuesday. Knees high, a whole drunken military style thing. When security came to him to escort him out they said "Chesty, you know the rules. Can't be drunk in here." To which Chesty replied "I'm drunk because of the f-f-f-fucking Fringe!" and pissed himself. And then he stomped faster to get outside and away from security while urine ran down his legs. Once outside he fled the downtown Biz folk and hopped on a number 18 bus. So that's good times at the library.

Oh and yesterday a man was looking for information on the Acadian Village that was mentioned in the Free Press travel section on the weekend. I brought him to an internet terminal and got him to the site listed. "Can we print this off?" he asked. I find a lot of people who don't understand the internet want to go to a site and print the whole thing off. Which doesn't work. We found an address for him to write to and a phone number to call so they could send him information. When that was found he stood up and asked "How much do I owe you?" I declined, but he rummaged through his pockets pulling out a couple of loonies. "I'm not looking for a handout. You were very helpful." I explained how tips were not necessary or allowed and that was just how the library worked. He waved as he left.
