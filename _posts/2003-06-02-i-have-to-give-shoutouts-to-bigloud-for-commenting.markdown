I have to give shoutouts to BigLoud for commenting on that last post.  Not because I'm going to talk about Air Canada or anything like that for my story, but because when I had to pull out my computer to show my prof a bit of research I'd done and the House of Snacks was up in Camino (fuck you IE!) It did not say in allcaps "NO FUCKING COMMENTS"  It's the kind of thing that leaps out at profs sometimes.  So now I have to make sure I get a couple more posts in here so the next time leaves me without this post right at the top, I guess.  And now I've noticed that that's on the DJS5 blog not this one.  So I wouldn't have had the allcaps anyway.  Selah.
  

  
Other news.  I'm writing this in the UWO library.  I've never really used the portability of a computer before, but today it saved my ass because I could whip out the mac and show my prof the exact bylaw that I was talking about it, because I'd bookmarked it the night before.  Wunderbar.  "Read my fucking bylaw!" - Transmetropolitan reference 36a.
  

  
Tomorrow is a day of prepping lots of granola for when Big Loud and the African show up.  And getting a free lunch, and a cheque, and a day without work, and maybe seeing that Conviction movie (Dustin Hoffman, gay crimelord).  Toods for now.
