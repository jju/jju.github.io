[AlterNet: The Pleasant Probation of Tommy Chong](http://alternet.org/drugreporter/21447/): 

<blockquote>"That's why people that have an education, you know, that's why they spend time in art museums, or reading good literature or listening to good music. Because it affects the body's chemistry in such a way that it produces a very mellow high that you can never reproduce with any kind of drugs. You can't even come close to that. Maybe heroin, maybe, is the closest."</blockquote>

But, as I constantly remind people, in China heroin is cheap, (English) books are expensive.
