On Monday I was doing some game prep on my old PowerBook and man, does one ever get used to a new computer quickly. The old keyboard felt so strange and mushy, and everything was so slow. Buying the new iMac (which I have dubbed Monolith) was a good choice.

Did you know there's a form you can fill out and give to the city to allow city crews to eliminate the graffiti on your property? One of the owners in our building wants to submit one, and while I have no particular attachment to the tags on our back lane wall, I'm considering protesting just in case we get something nice some time. Although I guess it is a one year term that needs to be renewed.

Today is a Storytime day. I think my theme is houses and homes and stuff. I do not remember what stories I picked. I cut my hair since last week so I wonder if any of the kids'll freak out.
