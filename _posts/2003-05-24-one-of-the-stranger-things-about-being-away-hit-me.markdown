One of the stranger things about being away hit me today.  My mom fucked up her back on Saturday and was in hideous pain and couldn't go to work all week.  I learned this this morning.  For these seven days I had a continuously wrong image of how she was spending her time.  With everyone else I accept that I don't know anything about them and what they do, but this is my mom, the person I know better than I know anyone else.  I mean, I can make some reasonable guesses, but that's it, and now that's also it for her.  So, the moral of the story is that living with someone for 22.5 years does not establish any sort of telepathy.

Other news:  I have actual work to do.  Craziness ensues.
