My new place here is very different from living at Brenda and Marlis'. It feels more like what I think of Vancouver being like from the outside. I've got all that [City of Glass](http://www.librarything.com/work/175177) stuff surrounding me now (that'd be the Douglas Coupland book, not the Paul Auster one, which is about New York).

This afternoon as I was wandering around getting acquainted with the neighbourhood (Coal Harbour) I walked down to the water and watched little seaplanes at the Harbour Airport. Across the water was North Vancouver with a mountain behind it. To  my left, islands and Stanley Park all filled with trees. It was cool but not freezing and ships were passing by, far away. It felt very Pacific-Canadian, very much like how it should feel to be here.

I'm going to start taking more pictures, I think. I mean, I live here now. I want to start to get attached to the city, to make it feel like home. It's harder to do that when you're thinking of leaving again in a few months. But I think I'm going to try to stay when I'm done my degree. All I need to do that is to find work, right?
