This morning I got a phone call inviting me out for lunch.  Happily it was Miss Hu, the head of the Foreign Affairs Office (as opposed to the Miss Wang I usually talk about who is an assistant in said office), so she knew not to phone me at 7 in the morning!  That's what happened on Sunday when students invited themselves over for lunch.  No weekend concept whatsoever.  But Miss Hu's been to the States (and has children who are vaguely my age, and is generally a sensible and thoughtful person) so I appreciated the timing of the call.  
  
Sadly, I had to delay heading out to her place until TMac missed his first foul shot with 4.7 seconds left in the Mavs-Rockets game, which prompted a worried follow-up call to make sure I was still coming.  
  
It was a great lunch.  We had jiaozi.  Some with pork & mushroom, some pork & cabbage, and some with chicken!  Chicken in jiaozi!  It was excellent.    
  
Miss Hu's nephew was there and we talked and talked about stuff.  He's a (pre?) law student at a university in Chongqing and has really good English.  Everyone had English; it was pretty weird.  Oh no, Miss Hu's husband and sister-in-law didn't.  Anyway, I digress.  
  
Well, actually I don't digress too far since there wasn't that much more to it.  It was a nice lunch.  Miss Hu's 15-year-old son plays a wicked keyboard.  He won a national competition last year. We saw a video, and it's really impressive how the competition really makes use of the synthesizer aspects.  His competition piece was a Xinjiang styled folk piece and he's playing a whole orchestra on that keyboard: drums, strings, pipes, the works.    
  
But he can't drag it down to the park.  
  
Aww, Sean's blogging again at the appropriately-titled (and capitalized) [INCOHERENT RAMBLINGS OF THE MALCONTENT](http://blogmetodeath.blogspot.com/).  It was his blog that originally inspired me to get this one so make full circle motions and sing about cats in cradles and such.
