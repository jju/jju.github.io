I just watched a couple of movies I've been wanting to see and that I will have to buy again.
  

  
First up: Sin City.  Wowie wow, that was a beautiful flick.  And when I say beautiful, I mean drenched with blood.  I think the Marv segment was my favourite, but it's hard to say.  I loved how not quite right Benicio del Toro looked.  I loved the writing, natch.  I even loved how all the cars looked like they were hovering above the roads.  I just don't know which part Tarantino directed.  Little help?  But the audio was fucked up.  I think this was a pirated version from making the DVD because almost none of the dialogue synced up and some lines were left out and stuff.  And it was in fullscreen (angrily shaken fist).
  

  
Next movie: Batman Begins.  This one was tough.  I put it in my player, let the bats flutter off the screen, only to find it was in Russian.  Which I sort of expected (remember Episode III).  And there was no audio option for English.  And the English subtitles were to a different movie.  Nonetheless I watched the movie.  I liked the first real Batman fight where he's going all Alien on the criminals, striking from nowhere so you barely see him at all.  I loved the drunken billionaire headline at the end.  
  

  
Was the fat slobby cop supposed to be Harvey Bullock?  Cause my impression of Bullock has always been that he hates Batman but he's one of the few cops in Gotham that isn't corrupt, and this guy seemed to be on the take when he was having dinner with that crime boss.  And I had no idea Lucius Fox had started out as a tech guy.  Is that a normal continuity bit or just for this movie?
  

  
Now I have some marking to do.
