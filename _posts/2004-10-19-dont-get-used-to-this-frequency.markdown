Alright, let's just call this the most eventful day I've had in China and be done with it already.

I just got off the phone with a girl Xian Qian (no clue at all) who called very politely and sang a fragment of You Are My Sunshine and talked about her middle school and asked about my plans for Christmas before realizing that I was not the droids she was looking for.  She thought she was talking to the former foreign teacher who lived here named Johns.

And I feel like a really shitty journalist because at about 11pm I heard 6 controlled explosion noises and saw flashes from downtown.  I imagine it was connected to the soldiers and the cops and everything.  I was getting ready for bed and didn't throw on my clothes and grab a camera and rush down there.  I also hadn't had the fortitude to stay down there earlier so I would know what happened.  As it is now, I'll have to rely on rumour hearsay and lies to find out what happened.
