I didn't get a chance to get Ren ordained last night 'cause I went to a Bahai Ridvan (pronounced Riz-Won) celebration at the Bahai centre instead.  And tonight I'm going to see Kids in the Hall!  Hooray for life and being employed again so I can drop the stupid amount of money that it costs to sit in the second balcony!  Hooray for new material!  Hooray for it not sucking!  I'm a tad worried, but that's okay.  Everything good comes with some worries attached that you just have to deal with or ignore.  Keep expectations low and such.  Or something.  I'm going to have a nap and a shower.  Toodle-fucking-oo!
