One of the things I like about Sydney is the noise the birds make when I'm leaving the office. They're kind of aggressive in their "wump twoorl twoorl" noises, but only aggressive in the most subtle way. They aren't the cries of dive-bombing assholes, but animals freely chatting, rooftop to rooftop.

The aggression comes from the strangeness in my ears I guess. They sound too jungly to be in a city, free. It's like there's been a jailbreak in the zoo's tropical house. Just the fact they're calling out to each other, fearless, makes you aware you're not at home. Much more than a coriolis effect (which I haven't examined).
