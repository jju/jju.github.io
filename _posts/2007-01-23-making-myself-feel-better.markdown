I really like Cat & Girl when [the comic gets on about travel](http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=419).  It's almost like self-justification for the fact that here I sit, not travelling.  Using up my money on rent and food instead of Lodging and Fuel.  It's been six months since I've been anywhere.  And now I have a job.  That isn't rapidly expanding my savings account so I can quit it.  Hooray.
