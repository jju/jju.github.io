And we have realized that no one actually thought the music situation was a big deal.  Rachael just stopped by to let me know that she was sorry for making it seem like it was a big deal to her.  She said she was trying to "read" me too much and thought I thought it was a big deal to play my music in the living room and/or wait till 10am.  While I thought the whole thing was stupid.  
  
It seems she's used to people who find stupid things to be a huge problem.  I, of course, am arrogant enough to consider lots of (most?) things stupid.  I can try dressing that up in some sort of Eastern non-attachment/sense of humour dressing, but the practical side of it is that when most things are stupid you realize lasting anger is also stupid.  Now I just get casually mad, fleetingly maybe.  But then I realize that that's how everything is and it goes away.  
  
So yeah.  Hopefully that's the end of the Rachael-fuelled blogging for a while.  Till she starts working night-shifts and we get to argue over what's suitable household daytime activity.  But that's months away.
