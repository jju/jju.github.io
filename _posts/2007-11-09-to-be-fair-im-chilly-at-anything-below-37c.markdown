Because I am a good roommate I sat on the porch this evening to hear about Alison's second horrible day at work in a row. Not that I wasn't listening to her woes about the mother of the kid who won't stop shitting himself, but I really enjoyed the sound of the snow/ice pellets hitting the branches surrounding the house. Sort of sounded like being under a My Little Pony rockslide. Of course, it's hard to appreciate with the speed at which my extremities have blood shunted away from them due to the temperature. It'll only get what, forty degrees colder this year?
