I had an excellent afternoon of RPGing today. Marek and Sam and I were playtesting a rules-light system of Marek's creation and the story he cooked up for it was a set-in-Vancouver "what kind of apocalypse happened while we were stuck out on a Gulf island?" kind of deal. It played out really quite well. 

Here's a video about the fungus the scenario was inspired by:
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8?rel=0&w=560&h=315]In the game, there was a version of this fungus affecting humans, which made for some good terrible zombie movie gaming.

One character got infected by the fungus zombie plague and sort of sacrificed himself, another was decapitated in the final escape sequence, my character who likes to run drew fungus zombies off the rest of the group's trail so they could get more ammunition (which proved kind of useless), and it all ended with a fireball and us saving the young girl and heading back to the island we never should have left in the first place.

Moral of the story (as it is for so many horror movies): Never leave home.
