A friend of mine mentioned this poem, [Theme for English B](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~keith/poems/English_B.html), in a mass email and said "Thanks Justin" after quoting it.  I had to look it up to see if she was thanking me.  As far as I can tell she wasn't because I'd never heard of it before.  I kind of liked it though.    
  
So now if anyone mentions this poem in a mass email and says Thanks Justin, I will assume they read my blog and are referring to me.
