Someday I will go somewhere that has beautiful weather when I am actually there.  Today is not some day.  Clouds are hanging well below Victoria Peak and it's spitting rain and wind.  So I'm on my way to a museum.

Yesterday I had an amazing afternoon hanging out at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.  It was Free Admission Wednesday and they've got some neat stuff.  But the best was undoubtedly the Huang Hongyu exhibit.  I love how Chinese art has writing on it.  So it's a bit like having a built in commentary.  Example: A Painting of an angry cat and a sad skinny old guy with a broken stringed instrument.  The writing (translated of course):


<blockquote>Spring time. Mating time. Hear the pussy call.

The monk may share the pussy mind but dare not show it off to all.</blockquote>


And in the exhibit I learned that this guy's a smart funny 80 year old, and I'm sure he knew all the connotations of those word choices.

I also went to a movie at a wicked little theatre.  I saw Closer, which while it's true it's not very HK, it was good.  And as [Suzanne](http://fallingdown7times.blogspot.com) told me months ago, Julia Roberts did not ruin the movie.

This city is a great place to be listening to music as you walk down the street.  The soundtrack element to it just works so well.  You feel like you're somewhere not unimportant to some story.

I ate a really decent sandwich yesterday, but forgot to get Indian food.  Tonight.
