On Sunday we had a group using the Carols Shields Auditorium. A group with a primarily elderly audience. After the presentation was done one of the elderly women made her way to our desk to inform me of a wonderful idea she'd had. 

"The room is very plain," she said. "You know. You've been in there. All those blank walls. And years ago I read a book by Carol Shields and now I collect salt and pepper shakers in the shapes of different animals." She went on for a while about the many varieties of dog salt shakers she has. "So you see, because this was inspired by Carol Shields you might like them for the room. So it's not so plain."

I tried to explain that the auditorium wasn't a gallery, but if she wanted to display her collection of salt and pepper shakers she could use the gallery space outside the auditorium, though there would be a fee. "No! I want to give them to you so you can decorate the Carol Shields room. Because they were inspired by her book. They don't make these any more. They're very valuable!"

So I told her someone would get back to her. It's fun being the officially least responsible person in the department.

Today two women came up to me looking for a computer at about 4:30. They had a paper with the following written on it: "#523 4:22-5:22" They said they were looking for their computer. The people said it was up on the second floor. Now, on our floor we don't have computer #523, we do have computer #563 though, so I got the one woman's card to see where her booking actually was. Perhaps she'd misread the computer number or miswrote it. Whatever. So I check her patron record and she has no bookings at all. I say this. The other woman (whose card it isn't) gets all mad like I'd just destroyed their booking. 

I ask if they'd like to book a different computer, since I was in the booking record area on the computer anyway. The indignant woman says yes. Since by now it's after 4:30 the next booking I can get is at 5pm. So I book a computer and write it down. Mad woman says "I go to work at 5. We can't use this." I cancel the booking and say, "Come, let's see if we can find a free computer you don't need to book." We get to the computers and a woman is getting up from a computer. "Are you done with that?" I ask. "Yes," she says, "But it's booked at 5." So I turn to the women who need a computer and tell them "You can use this computer now." And the mad woman says "No! Useless!" and dismisses me. My walk back to the desk was spent telling them off for not knowing what the fuck they wanted. In a subdued undertone of course.
