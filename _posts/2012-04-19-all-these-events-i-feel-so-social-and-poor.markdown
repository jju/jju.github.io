Post-school life is starting to come together (though I kind of need a job). I mean, I have classes coming up again in May, but now that all my friends have graduated it kind of feels like I have too. I've also gotten to [play a new game](http://librarianaut.com/2012/04/15/game-review-fiasco/) and [go to a conference](http://librarianaut.com/2012/04/15/ifla-indigenous-knowledges-conference-responsereflection/) and be part of Jamie's four-night trivia blitz.

For a research project I'm working on I got to interview a former National Librarian of Canada last week, and she was adamant that going to conferences without having a job to do is pointless. I think that makes sense. This Saturday I'm going to be doing some liveblogging for the [North Shore Writers Festival](http://northshorewritersfestival.com/), which should be fun. I'm going to be a convenor for the [BC Library Conference](http://www.bclibraryconference.ca/) in the middle of May and I'm volunteering at [VanCAF](http://www.vancaf.com/). I mean, I had fun wandering around at Emerald City, but I do like having something to do.

Also, when Sean comes to town in June the Vancouver Canadians will be playing. It works out that we'll be able to go to a baseball game in the afternoon and then the Bombers-Lions CFL season opener in the evening.
