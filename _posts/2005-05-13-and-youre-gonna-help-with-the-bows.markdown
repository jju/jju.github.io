Where does the day go?
  

  
I woke up this morning and did my normal puttering around on the net.  Then it was about 9 o'clock and it started raining.  I thought to myself, well, I'll just play some God of War until the rain stops and I can go out and find something to do.  Next time I looked up it was 7 at night and I figured I should get something to eat.
  

  
This is why I'm careful not to play the ol' PS2 every day.
  

  
It was a weirdly foggy day today.  The kind of day where there's no evidence that the world is bigger than about 599m across.  So it wasn't a bad day to live in a really gory and pretty world that's only 27".
  

  
If you have a PS2 (I don't know if it's on Xbox or not) get God of War.  Best "beat the crap out of Greek mythology" game ever.
