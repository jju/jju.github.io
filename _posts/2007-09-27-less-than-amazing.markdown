Alison bought the DVD of Death Proof so I watched it this afternoon.  This extended version fills in a bit more so it makes more sense as a movie, but still. I mean, it's cool and all, but the complete lack of story bugged me a lot more this second time. I still like Tarantino dialogue, but the whole thing is just lacking, especially if you don't really care about all the movies Stuntman Mike references.  The Rodriguez one was cheesy as hell, but it told a story. I wonder if the other one will get all the trailers that the double feature had.
