We're almost done here in Beijing, and by we I mean the entire [organization redacted] crew.  It's down to last minute shopping trips and acrobat performances.  Supposedly my airplane ticket back to CQ is on its way.  
  
Yesterday Holly and Peter and I were coming back from Wudaokou after dinner when it started to rain.  Wudaokou isn't that far from the centre where we do our stuff, but not that far in Beijing means it only takes an hour to walk there.  The bus we normally take is the 307, which is a line whose fleet is all dilapidated survivors from the Red Guard flipping them over in the 70s (probably never happened).  As we were waiting we thought maybe we'd take a cab, but then it started raining.  It is impossible to get a cab when it is raining, presumably because everyone wants one.  After some frustrated cab flagging the bus showed up and we packed in.  
  
There are a lot of people in China.  Fewer in Beijing but still more than you'd be able to count if you had a free afternoon.  There were even fewer people on this bus.  I'm afraid I can't narrow it down for you any more than that.  It was hard to see much being held up by the pressure from everyone else's bodies who were also in there.  I just went limp for the whole ride through a BJ traffic jam.
