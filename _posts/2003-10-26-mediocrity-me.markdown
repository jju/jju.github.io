So I finished my radio feature today.  Now I just have to worry about the NewMedia project, radio greens, a newsmagazine, the Media & Politics presentation/paper, whatever I'll have to do for Media & Law and all the stuff that'll come up when I start Print in a couple of weeks.  The feature isn't good.  I'm not nearly as happy with it as I could be.  But it has the advantage of being done.  Selah.  And now I'm reading Still Life With Woodpecker, by Tom Robbins.  I feel so movie deprived, but I can't really spend any money to see Kill Bill or Mystic River or anything else since I'm down to $5 left for the month (stupid wedding expenses).  Amazingly enough, I actually borrowed a bunch of books to get me through the week instead of buying any.  I was impressed with me.  Not much but a little.
