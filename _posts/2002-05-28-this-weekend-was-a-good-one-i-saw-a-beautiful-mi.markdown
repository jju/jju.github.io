This weekend was a good one.  I saw A Beautiful Mind on Friday, and was very pissed off that the movie was exactly what I had thought it was going to be when I went in.  Maybe I'm just a curmedgeonly sort, but there wasn't anything in it movie that made me go "Wow, they actually didn't make this movie for the sole purpose of getting Ron Howard a golden naked man."  But the guy from Gangster No. 1 was in it, and there were a few good arrogant genius lines.  There was a veritable Kundera-fest at church on Sunday as I was finishing Immortality and Aileen was reading Life is Elsewhere.  Now I'm rereading The Unbearable Lightness of Being and it's so much better this time around.  Got an email from Jimbo today.  Talking about Star Wars.  Nice.  Hassie's back (the final nightmare) and it was nice just hanging out on Saturday.  Everybody!  Go to bars when drunken rugby teams are there!  It's all good!  I was thinking at work today about what constitutes kindness and being kind.  And I shoveled rocks and transplanted shrubbery.  Now I'm going to see Spiderman (who Warren Ellis thinks should be killed off permanently, and he makes a convincing argument).
