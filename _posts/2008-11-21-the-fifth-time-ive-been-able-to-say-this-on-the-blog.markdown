I have a new job! I'll be back at Millennium but on the second floor in Special Services. That means no more storytimes (boo!) but a lot more crazy people (yay!) and a much shorter trip to work (especially good since this morning with the windchill it was -25C and I was walking from Logan).

Since we're so short staffed now at Sir William Stephenson, I probably won't be heading downtown till the new year. It feels good though. I was only out there for four months (five once I'm done) and now I feel like I have a handle on the Children's Services kind of thing. Now for the blind people and video watchers. I really enjoy starting a new job, doing new stuff. And the hours are pretty good too. More than I'm guaranteed where I am, but not so many I can't find the time to get the writing done. Though I've been doing a lot of figuring on this next draft in my head on the walks home recently instead of at my busted keyboard. Not busted, just still missing its Y key.
