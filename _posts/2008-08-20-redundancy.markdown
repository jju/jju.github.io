Down at the Extra Foods two minutes from my place I bought a reusable grocery bag with my groceries. And the cashier woman still put the stuff (much less than a bag's worth) in four plastic bags. I must be more vigilant in the future.

But the muffins I made with those groceries are tolerable, so it all evens out.
