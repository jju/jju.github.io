Here's another blog to add to your trawling: [Jared's Mozambique Adventure](http://jpmozambique.blogspot.com/).
  

  
You may know Jared as your 11th grade bio partner / wine-store hippie / writer of creepily earnest emails.  He'll be in Africa for 7 months with [MEDA](http://www.meda.org) as an intern of some sort.  It's just begun and he's not gone yet, but it could be interesting.  
  

  
I wonder if he had to promise to keep his links clean so he can be bandying about his organization's name.
