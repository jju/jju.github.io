I'm back from a great weekend away.  It's funny how really we didn't do much, but it was still a good time.  Sitting around talking about CBC and books can be quite enthralling with the right people, which Caroline and Brian definitely are.  I mean, we went to the mountains since one of the main thing you do as a Calgarian is leave Calgary, but it was all very relaxed kind of stuff.  I guess I can say that because I didn't do any of the driving.

Near the Greyhound station in Brandon there's a sign that reads: "Secure Your Future - Enroll in a cosmetology course today."  I thought a bit about my future and if it was flapping around enough that Brandon cosmetology was the thing I needed.  I decided it wasn't.

In Calgary I killed some time on Monday morning watching people with shopping carts ferry between the Uptown Bottle Depot and Payless Liquor, before I discovered The Sentrybox was right near the bus station.

Anyway, good times.  Glad to get away.  Oh, and Caroline have you found my "Thanks for having me" gift yet?
