It's sort of funny how closely my sick day yesterday resembled every other day.  I woke up plugged up coughing achy, all that stuff that happens when you're sick.  I spent the day reading about zombies and how to prepare for a zombie outbreak.  Things like what to store on the second floor of your house so you can destroy the stairs and survive a siege until rescue comes.  
  
I'm working a few extra shifts this week.  The great library book sale is going to start soon so I'm hauling shelves and books up to the second floor.  Yeeha.
