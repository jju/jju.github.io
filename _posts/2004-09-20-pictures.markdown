Check out more pictures of mine at [flickr.com](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/).  I can just dump a bunch up there.  Ones I like will still be put on the [pictures](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/pictures.html) page.  
  
I didn't sleep at all last night (as in I tried but was pitifully unsuccessful), but it doesn't seem to have affected my classes so far today.  And I really have to get my act together when it comes to photocopying articles earlier.  But I did get them done without any help.  I wrote down the number of copies I needed to back up my oral question.  I think they'll be done this afternoon.  I hope.
