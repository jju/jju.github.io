The shelves are in, and I hope we didn't do too much more damage to Sean's shoulder doing it. I emptied the last of the boxes onto the shelves and spent a few hours organizing. All the fiction is arranged along with the nonfiction up to the theology collection. I'm doing the nonfiction in a sort of rough Dewey, just getting things sort of organized by subject. There's not that much of it though, since I do prefer my worlds imaginary. Interesting (to me) note: the dividing point between the two main fiction shelves (organized by author's surname) came in the mid Ks. I would have thought my library leaned more to the second half of the alphabet

Now the only thing I have left to do to start feeling well and truly settled is get some more art on the walls. To do that I'll need a hammer. And some picture frames. I saw the painting Alison's working on for me the other night. It's going to have a rhinoceros on it if she remembers.

Tomorrow is my interview for the Special Services job down at Millennium. We were talking about how our hiring system works the other day and the conclusion was that since it's seniority based there's no pressure at all on the interviewee. The interview is just for me to find out more about the position, to make sure I'd be happy with it, not for them to see if they'd like me. Of course if I'm the second person in line and they do like me it doesn't matter, but there's nothing I can do 'bout that.
