For those of you who might be planning a bachelor party sometime in the future (Mayish?) [some ideas from a cartoon cat:](http://raysmuckles.blogspot.com/2007/10/beefs-bachelor-party-hard-plans.html)

<blockquote>I wrote much plans for Roast Beef's bachelor party in this cool retro-lookin' leather bound notebook I picked up at Restoration Hardware today. I even wrote 'em all out with a fountain pen, usin' my best scrawl, in case it might be a thing I can present to him like on their fiftieth wedding anniversary.</blockquote>

Three activities are outlined. Plus the usual pony, shotgun and shallow grave accoutrements.
