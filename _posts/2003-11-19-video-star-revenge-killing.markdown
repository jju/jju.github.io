I'm in the radio room at school.  Not a poetic kind of place.  No chasms to lose yourself in.  No expanses of sky.  Just 6 computers running XP that are set to look like they're running 2000.  Ludmilla is extracting radio journalistic gold from her steaming brain and fingers.  I am still damp from the evening's rains.
  

  
The last two days have been getting busy.  I've done two presentations (one of which I forgot my video tape for so I had to act out all the clips), the interview for my profile, and written an essay, a resume, a letter, a set of 3 video introductions so that I can get my life handed to me on a plate.  A plate!  That last bit has to do with the Donaldson Newsworld Scholarship.  Tomorrow Ludmilla will hand in my package of all that stuff (because I will be in court trying to find a story) so it can compete to be one of five packages that gets sent to the CBC.  CBC will then compare them with stuff from people in Jschools across Canada.  If they like my stuff at that stage they will interview me.  If I am one of the eight best interviewed applicants from across Canada, I get a summer internship with CBC Newsworld that will turn into a real job if I don't fuck it up.  This is the main way that CBC recruits new blood, hiring freezes be damned.  I want this.  A lot.  I think.
