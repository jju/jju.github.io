I'm sorry for reading in your classes. I'm sorry for not paying attention.  I'm sorry for any looks of boredom I shot you when you lectured about something I could just read in the book.
  

  
I'm sorry for being quiet and not asking any questions or making any comments when I could see thast you were dying up there.  I'm sorry for trying to ignore you while I felt embarrassed for you and for my class.
  

  
I'm sorry for not doing my homework and just winging it when I got to class.  I didn't realize that you had to prepare things, and had to prepare to answer the smart-ass questions us lazy punks could throw at you from the tops of our heads.
  

  
And Mr. Karl Wiebe, I'm sorry you're an asshole.
