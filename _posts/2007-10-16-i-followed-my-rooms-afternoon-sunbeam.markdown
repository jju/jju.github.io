Today was my last day off until next Tuesday. Not that my work is especially strenuous or requires me to set an alarm or anything, but I've still got to go in every day for a week. Woe is me.

I made the most of my day by buying some groceries and getting a good amount of writing done and reading most of _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ Today on Wil Wheaton's blog he [wrote about something Neil Gaiman wrote on his blog](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2007/10/trudging-throug.html)Â  which I'd also read and been inspired by. Because the last while I've been thinking about how really bad I am at this novel thing. I mean, I'm sort of accumulating stuff but a lot of it sucks horribly.

I hate sucking horribly.

The other day at [Times](http://highandlonesomeclub.ca) we Sean and Steve and I ran into Devon Dyck, a guy we went to high school with. I hate how pathetic I sound when someone asks what I'm doing now. "Nothing really." Devon followed that up with a "You've been back a year and a half and are still doing nothing?" sort of comment and I made some reference to the library. It's not like I'm going to say anything about what I'm writing since nothing's finished (not entirely true, but 3 first issue scripts for comics aren't anything without any pictures to go with them) and being a writer is something anyone can and will challenge pretty easily. I know my mom says things to people about me working on a novel but I don't know if she really realizes that it's not the kind of thing that'll be done in a few months (or be any good when it is done).

Yes there's defeatist whining in here. Sorry. Hopefully tomorrow I'll feel better about things. I did have a good day.
