You know when you think you're cool with something and then it just kicks you in the testicles (or ovaries) for some reason that looks an awful lot like spite even though you're sure it's just that you've seen up someone else's updraft from the grate below?  That's where I'm at.  However, I think I'll vomit up my guts in the bathroom instead of spilling on you people.
