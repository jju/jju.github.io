It's not as bad as it seems at first glance, but it's pretty funny. [Avril Lavigne's](http://www.hanzismatter.com/2005/03/wrong-country-avril-lavigne_30.html) promotional pictures for a Hong Kong concert show her with the characters for "Japan is great" in marker up her arm.  To be fair the picture was probably from a show in Japan.
