[Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/view.php3) is one of the kings of the webcomic block.  The comic is topical on videogames and other geek news kinds of things.  It also has rabid fans, many of whom seem to be idiots.  All over the internet, one of the main reasons people don't like PA is because of its fans.  Sigh.  
  
Anyway, I bring this up because Tycho (aka Jerry Holkins) writes blog posts to go with each comic.  Often they're pretty essential to understand what the comic is referring to.  He's clever and writes really well.  But [this post](http://penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2005-05-09) struck something near to my heart, leaving a notch in one of my ribs (L4 I think).    
  
It's a followup to a comic and post about a huge movie deal that his artistic partner Gabe [stumbled into](http://penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2005-05-04) that people apparently took to be serious.  He's writing an explanation of how ridiculous things are ridiculous and even if they are said with a straight face (or with an absence of smilies or whatever) doesn't mean they are true.  
  
This is a philosophy that has guided me for a long time, but is something I cannot rely on at all out here.  Ridiculous things happen and are true.  I say things that seem obviously ridiculous to me and they are taken as the way things are out in crazy China.  
  
No, this isn't spurred by anything overly strange to report or assumptions to correct.  I'm just saying.
