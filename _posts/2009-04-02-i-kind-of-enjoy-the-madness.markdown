I made it through a couple of interactions with one of our schizophrenic patrons this week very well. This patron (who I refer to as Beard Lady) has an issue with the colour red. She also refers to herself as a philologist. And of course beards; she has a thing about beards. [I've talked](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2008/02/07/special-services/) [about her](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2008/05/11/tranquilizer-happy-folkswagon/) [before](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2008/05/26/the-beard-lady-followed-me-partway-home-tonight/).

But yes. She sometimes gets upset at people who wear red. I own a couple of red shirts and like to wear them, but on Tuesday when I put one on I recognized it was a gamble. I wore a zip-up hoodie that could hide most of it if Beard Lady was in and got angry with me. She was in that day and when she was getting the remote for the TV she not only handed it directly to me, she said "Yes. You look good in that. That red." And then she left. And the rest of the SS staff were kind of shocked. When some people have a bit of a reddish scarf, Beard Lady has gone on about how it looks like their throat's been slashed. "You know how I feel about red!" she has screamed at staff.

Then yesterday she came in with the letter she'd just sent to Paul Newman with a tiny photocopy of the DVD cover to [Nobody's Fool](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110684/) and she wanted me to print off a copy of that picture from our printer because then it would have the day's date on it. "And isn't it special to have Nobody's Fool on April Fool's Day? Paul Newman and Gary Oldman should have been in a movie together. Wouldn't that be special? I wonder how many people from Newman street in Winnipeg wrote to Paul Newman. He's never told me." 

And she was talking about how even though he's dead nobody can go to the funeral. And one time she went to the funeral and said she was family and they asked her for ID (she said, incredulously). "Nobody will be able to go to your funeral. They won't let anyone in to anybody's. And no one will know where your tombstone is." I said, "Unless you're [Ozymandias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias_(name))." Which set her off (in a good way). "I've never heard that word before (and I'm a philologist)! Write it down for me! They let people go see his grave? And there are 54 tombstones in Winnipeg you know. I counted..." While she went on I wrote it down for her and she left me another of her strips of paper photocopied from a dictionary that she seems to use as a business card. 

So it seems I've maybe made a new friend, to replace the Sikh gentleman from Intrepid with his immigration papers. For now. Until I accidentally use her name in her presence, which I am told will cause a major flipping out.

Also yesterday, a patron was looking for Biblical feature films, and had the fortune to find Harriet on the desk. When I got back to the desk this guy (an older guy with a clear idea of what he wanted but didn't know exactly how to articulate it) was storming back and saying "I need you to help me find some videos because this woman doesn't know anything! She just yap yap yaps!" And Harriet was explaining where she'd been showing him videos and he was being rude and to restore some peace I took the guy into the VHS stacks to find out what he wanted. We talked it through and I couldn't find anything right there but went back to the desk to do some searching. Thankfully he stayed behind so there wouldn't be more arguing. Eventually we got him four videos and placed a hold on the [Ten Commandments](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/).
