I spent a chunk of the afternoon sneaking into a croatian cultural festival thing.  Went in the stage entrance, told the security guy:

I'm with the Montreal group.

"Performing?"

No, just with.

"You can't come in here."  You see, they didn't want anybody to just waltz in and not pay for a ticket.  Like me.

But I was told I could.

"Is your name on a list?"

Yes it is (No it wasn't).

"Okay, talk to her with the clipboard."

So in I walk and say to the clipboard girl, I'm with the Montreal group.

"Oh, Stczyrancizva (or some such unpronounceable name)?"

Yes I am.

"Are you the first one here?"

Looks that way.

"Dressing room A."

And down the stairs I went, before the first line of defence noticed what was happening.  I heard someone say "Hold on!" but pretended I didn't.  See, Kate's in that unpronouncably named Montreal dance group (along with Ross).  And I wanted to see Kate but didn't want to **pay** to see and listen to Croatian dancing and music.  We found each other at intermission and talked (along with Ross).  That's about it.  It being the excitement that is my long weekend.
