I almost fell into a trap there.  Sitting on the couch reading a book ([Marooned in Realtime](http://www.amazon.ca/Marooned-Realtime-Vernor-Vinge/dp/0765308843/)) I almost felt like turning on the televisory device.  There was poker on.  Poker I'd already seen.  That would be even worse than Guess Who Has the Best Card for no money, wouldn't it?  
  
Happily I shook myself out of it and will return to my time-travel murder mystery momentarily.
