On Monday I did my first LSA3 fill in shift. It was back at Millennium on the second floor in Special Services. I was pretty far down the list of people they could call for it, but I got in for a big long shift. Six and a half hours, which is much nicer than a long shift paging, as there's sitting involved. Much better for the knees. Though not so wonderful for the "avoiding police incidents" aspect of life.

You see at Special Services there are a couple of TVs, viewing stations we call them, for people to watch videos on. Patrons can book them for two hour blocks. One guy was booked from 11am-1pm. At 1:05 the next guy signed up for the TV came to the desk asking if he could get in there. They're out in the open and I could see the guy watching his video, so I headed over just to say "Hey dude, your time is up and there are people waiting." 

So I said that and the guy was all "I've got this booked till 3 o clock!" 

"No, you don't. You've got it booked till 1 o clock and there's someone waiting."

"I'm almost done. Give me five minutes."

At this point I wasn't sure what to do, so I headed back to the desk to ask someone more versed in this kind of thing what the next step was. I found out and headed back. "I'm very sorry sir, but the TV is booked all afternoon so I need you to let the next person on."

"This is ridiculous! I've got two minutes left!" At this point he's raising his voice at me.

"That's great. Then you won't miss very much," I said. "But if you don't turn it off now, I'll have to call security."

"That's stupid. This is ridiculous. You're stupid."

"Okay. I'll be back."

I called security and they escorted him from the TV. He came by the desk to drop off his DVDs and remote and I was trying to get them back from him through his "You're an idiot. Why do they let so many idiots work in the library." I thanked him for the stuff and security followed him from the building.

The supervisor was back out by then asking if I felt the need to file an incident report, and I said I didn't. I mean, he just called me an idiot. It didn't hurt my feelings or anything. Then the security guard came back up to let us know that the patron had called the police to file a complaint about how we "roughed him up." So I had to file an incident report.

It's all on video and it's nothing serious, but still kind of funny. And while I was filling out my incident report someone (unrelated) had pooped in the corner of the second floor, which meant another incident report. There was a running battle the rest of the afternoon to try and determine if the area had been properly sanitized.
