I neglected to ride my bike to school on Wednesday. No, not neglected. I chose not to, because I wanted to finish [the book I was reading](http://librarianaut.com/2012/02/18/book-review-the-quantum-thief/) on the bus. Which worked out, but man oh man I get frustrated waiting for overcrowded buses to get me home when I could be moving. I decided to bike on Friday to my 8am class to make up for the frustration (even though my schedule works well for comfortable Friday busing).

Part of not biking on Wednesday was because I failed to make it the whole way up the hill on Monday. Now, I was never really in shape as a younger man, so I don't have any real notion of being past my peak. I have friends who complain about being sore after playing sports that they used to do without ill effects. I have always had ill effects from sports, so I don't have some better time to compare things to. Due solely to never pushing my physical limits when I was younger, I still feel like I have room to improve my strength and fitness and whatever. Anything I did yesterday I should be able to do tomorrow. 

So on Monday when I had to stop and walk my bike up the last 10 metres to my normal "pause to survey the city" point, it sucked. And because it sucked I was scared that maybe that had been it, and I'd never be able to climb that hill again. But on Friday at sometime after 7am I did climb it in my normal fashion, and it was a bit of a relief.
