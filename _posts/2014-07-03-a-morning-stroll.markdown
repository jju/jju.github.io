I'm trying to feel better about this place I live. So one of the nice things about it is that I can walk to a provincial park. And, while I'm no connoisseur, I think it's a nice one.

This is kind of near the first entrance to the park. When I returned from this specific hike there were a bunch of little kids in the water wearing helmets and life jackets floating downstream learning how to avoid rocks or something, under the supervision of some sort of counsellor-type.

This is up at Elk Falls itself. I did not realize the falls were in such a canyon. This doesn't show the drama of the setting, but that's because I was out on my own and didn't have anyone to tell my tale if I plummeted to my death. Which I might have. I don't trust my body to keep me alive.

The walking took me through a bunch of this:

I startled a deer

and took a lot of pictures of flowers:

Then finally I found my way home past the generator station

So yeah. I should really do more walking out in this and appreciate it, right?
