In all the excitement of celebrating the actual date of Aileen's Ageosity (party pending) and another scene with Rachael this morning it looks like I didn't do a comic.  Two tomorrow then.  
  
This morning I didn't realize Rachael was home when I started painting at 9:40.  It wasn't Wednesday, her "only day to sleep in ever," so I thought I was safe.  When she came down to ask me to turn off my music until 10:00, I laughed and asked what good that would do.  "So I can go back to sleep!"  Feel free to point out that if it woke her up at 9:40, it probably would do the same twenty minutes later if she even fell asleep.  I did.  We had a bit of an argument in which she suggested I use headphones and I suggested she accept that I also have a right to exist in the house (the bit about me not existing solely to placate her remained unsaid).  
  
She told me how she's trying to rearrange her life around my horribly irregular habits, how she leaves the house to study at her parents' because she absolutely cannot read while music exists.  When she talked to Alison about the situation later she was saying that I don't have a right to exist on the main floor (not her exact words) because I don't go to work, while she does go to school.  I don't know if Alison was allowed to say that I do actually go to work, since that would be contradicting her royal idiocy.  
  
Alison is firmly in my corner on this but asked Rachael to draw up a list of what she wants in an ideal world, and what she's willing to compromise on.  I'm thinking I'll concede graciously if every time Rachael asks me (ahead of time) to not play music somewhere she uses the phrase "Since my life is oh so much more significant than yours, would you please not live your life in the vicinity of the main floor tomorrow between X and Y o clock."  That's probably pushing the passive-agressive thing a bit far though, isn't it?  
  
If you know anyone who'd like to move into our house (rent is cheap and if I like you, I'm an awesome roommate - Alison has no complaints) let me know so we can start burning bridges and not worry about Alison's lost rent revenue.  
  
My new story's going really well.  I'm not pushing it and the characters are beginning to come to life.  Pretty sweet.
