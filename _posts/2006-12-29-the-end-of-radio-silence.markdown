I've sort of taken this week off from my normal slavish routine.  Yesterday I built a Viking fort being attacked by the dragon Fafnir.  Which was great fun.  I also got [le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink) updated.    
  
My forms are in to the office where they needed to be for me to start work in a week and a half.  This whole process has taken a long time.  I feel like I've been working at Millenium for the month and a half since I did my interview, just without anything to show for it.  I'm looking forward to actually going there for work, and wonder if people who work there will recognize me.
