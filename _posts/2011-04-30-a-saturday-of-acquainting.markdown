I'm slowly getting things together here. And by getting things together I mean, haven't dissolved into a gibbering wreck just yet. In some ways it's crappy that my work permit hasn't come through, since it means I'm not, you know, earning money to pay for living here. But this enforced delay is giving me a bit more time to get acquainted with Sydney.

I went out walking again this morning. I read for a while and watched some birds in Hyde park. Then I took an excursion around the long way to get to the Rocks, the touristy harbour zone where the opera house is. While I was sitting on a bench watching a "sail" boat leave the wharf, I saw a crowd of nicely dressed (probably for a wedding) people running for cover. I got my rain jacket out of my bag just in time to get caught in the pissing rain. I went to share the wedding-folk shelter for ten minutes and then it eased off and then stopped and now it's sunny and beautiful out.

I'm in the State Library reading room which is quite nice. It's a huge old building with wooden shelves lining the walls three floors up, but the centre is completely open, with tables and computers and a couple of information desks. There's a passage way down to the reference library which is housed in the neighbouring and more modern building, but I'm kind of a fan of this space.

Soon I'll have to set out again. I need to get a SIM card to phone my boss to see when I should show up on Monday to meet people (and definitely not work because that would be illegal). There's also a game store a not unreasonable distance away. I'll keep busy.
