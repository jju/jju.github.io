This afternoon I baked cookies. I got a recipe from the internet and bought as many baking ingredients as I could carry home (I didn't have things like flour, sugar or baking powder until today) and then mixed them up and baked them. Woo.

Part of doing that baking was obligation. In our 6-9pm Children's Literature class on Wednesdays people generally bring food to keep our blood sugar up, and I'd volunteered for tomorrow. But more generally, I have to do these things sometimes to remember that I can and kind of enjoy turning ingredients into finished products.

I was thinking about that after reading [Jessie Thorn's big thing on being successful doing what you love](http://transom.org/?p=24153) that was making its way around the intertubes yesterday. 

I spent my reading week getting schoolwork out of the way so now I've only got a very manageable amount of that left to do before the term is done. My summer is going to have some classes and lots of conferences and interviews and writing for this big IFLA project I'm working on, but nothing terribly overwhelming on the schoolfront. (Aileen notes that really, none of my schoolwork should be overwhelming, and as always I have to agree. It's not like I'm doing theoretical physics that undermines our understanding of the universe over here.)

Having the school stuff pretty much handled means its time to make cool things. Sometimes those things may be cookies. Most times those things will be word-based. I'm going to make some comics. One of the school things I have left to do is to create a book trailer. I have ideas for that, and if it goes well it might lead to more video-type projects.

No more laziness. Or at least, laziness only in measured doses.
