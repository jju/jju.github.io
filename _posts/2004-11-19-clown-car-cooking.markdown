The other day Aesion asked he if he and a couple of friends could come over to cook dinner on Friday.  They don't have kitchens in their dorms and get sick of eating cafeteria food all the time.  I said sure.  Yesterday he phoned and said that there were going to be eight of them.  That's a huge number for my tiny kitchen, nay for my entire apartment.  
  
Well they all showed up and cooked (6 girls, 2 guys).  There were minor inconveniences like not having a lid for my wok, and a shortage of bowls, but it all went pretty well.    
  
We watched a couple of Family Guy episodes and listened to music (sort of).  They wouldn't let me do anything to help except pose for countless pictures with them.  The girl in the picture told me how much she liked my beard and wished she could grow one like it.  I laughed.  
  
When I showed them pictures of my family and friends (everyone who comes over asks to see such things, so I have a slideshow ready to go on the computer) they liked my mom's treasure hoard on her ears and said she looked very young.
