49
  

  
So, tomorrow I get my tattoo.  I'm doing it now so it'll be completely healed up by the time Ren and I take off.  Tattoos are interesting things.  My rationale for getting what I am getting (and it will be the first not the last - unless I die or something) is that if someday I woke up with movieexceptMemento style amnesia I'd be able to help piece together important parts of my identity from interpreting the symbol on my arm.  This'll provide a better picture as I get more tattoos (right now the plan is to eventually get four).
  

  
I've been packing up all my books tonight for when the carpeting gets replaced, so they don't have to move hideously full bookshelves.
  

  
What the fuck is up with the pope?  Some people who vote themselves infallible and are one step below god.  Give me BattlePope thank you very much.  I want a pope who makes fun of demons' genitalia, who can tell stories that start "So I was bangin' this chick . . ." who hangs out with god's slacker hippie son, who was just as fucked as the rest of the world when god came back in all his glory.  Yeah.
