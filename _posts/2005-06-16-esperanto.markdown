The other day I went to dinner with Eric, the computer science teacher and one of my former students, Brick.  Nothing crazy about that, though Brick is the one who is trying to start a middle-school teacher training business and wants foreigners to help add some prestige.  Ha!
  

  
After dinner we went "for a stroll" and they brought me to the school's academy of fine arts, which is tucked away in a secluded corner.  Out there we ran into Miss Hu's daughter, who teaches in the department.  Eric tried to finagle a tour of a gallery out of her, but all the galleries were empty but for the desks.
  

  
Miss Hu's daughter, whose name I can't remember, doesn't speak any English.  And Eric and Brick were telling her she should know some, her mother was the dean of the English department for Pete's sake (neither of them actually invoked Pete).  
  

  
That kind of thing always makes me uncomfortable.  Ning Hua told me the other day that he'd tried to call me to go boating but couldn't get a hold of me (days of the deceased phone).  When he couldn't find me told one of his friends who hadn't wanted to go.  This friend said "Sure, if Justin isn't going then I'll go."  Ning Hua said it was because his English wasn't very good.
  

  
I completely understand.  I don't like hanging out with people who only speak Chinese, so why would they want to hang out with me?  They didn't ask me to come here so it's not their problem if I can't understand them.  Like Miss Hu's daughter.  She's an art teacher and it doesn't make her less of one because she doesn't speak English.
  

  
Maybe I'm wrong and just oversensitive to this because of my shittiness in Chinese, but I get a real sense of the English majors thinking they're better than the other students because of the language thing.  There's this constant ranking of English ability that bugs me immensely.
