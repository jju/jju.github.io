Fun day at the library today. They're tearing up the park outside the giant windowed wall with loads of jackhammering. I'm not sure if it's still a jackhammer when it's eight feet long and attached to 5 tonnes of machinery. Perhaps the operator is still named Jack. Anyway. The noise shakes its way through the entire fucking building. I know this is trivializing the lives people left to get away from harsh realities, but it feels like a warzone. Like it's all the slightly random hammering of artillery falling all around us. So everyone in the building is on edge.

Which led to me getting told off by Harriet. Antonine and I were talking about the new WiFi policy and how if we aren't allowed to help people there should be big signs saying so. And they shouldn't be advertising our WiFi as a service you can get at the library with any reliability. Harriet was saying her piece, and Antonine and I were telling her how it's us shmucks at the desk who look like assholes if we follow this policy of not being able to at least call IT. We are the ones people blame and get huffy with, not the administration whose bright idea this may or may not be (we have trust issues in our department in that Harriet makes up rules to try and bully people out of arguments).

So we were discussing the situation, then Antonine had to help a patron, so it was just Harriet and I. I repeat how this is a lousy policy and we are the ones who look like jerks. Harriet tells me it's an imperfect situation, and I respond by saying "But we could make it better." She tells me I'll have to learn to live in the real world some time. And I turn around and go back to work before I say something disrespectful out loud. Antonine returns to the desk and Harriet leaves.

But then Harriet comes back and Antonine starts trying to explain our position to her. They're standing towards the back of the desk area, away from the place where we help patrons (where I'm sitting). Mary is beside me. At one point Antonine makes some point we've been stressing and Harriet doesn't understand, so I swivel my chair and chime in with a comment backing Antonine up. Harriet gets this frowny face on and is all "Justin, I'm having a conversation with Antonine here and you can stay out of it." 

"But we're talking about the same thing!" I reply, as if explaining to a child. Mary chimes in here too and it makes Harriet's head explode.

"I can't deal with so many people at once I can talk to one person at a time and I don't need you barging in..." she flaps around. I've got a patron arriving at my desk so I turn from the spitshow back there to help him find some movies. Antonine tells her that if she can only talk to one person at a time maybe they should go to Harriet's office. Which they did. And Antonine came out ten minutes later just mad. We spent a good 45 minutes letting blood pressures get back to normal.

I don't know, I kind of like this whole not backing down to the stupid. It's good having an adversary to be a little confrontational with. To see the bad way it's going and try making it right even though no one will let you. Maybe I'm just thinking this way because of reading [Little Brother](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2009/12/03/book-review-little-brother/); that book really got into my head, or at least my glands. Made me remember being a high school jerk who was right about so many things and suffered fools not so well. Our department likes to think it has a bit of a reputation in Millennium as trouble makers. And man, it's good to make trouble. I was all alive feeling. It was good.
