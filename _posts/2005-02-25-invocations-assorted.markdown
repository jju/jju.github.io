One thing about being back in Wanzhou after time in Hong Kong is that I'm back to being a laowai. This essentially means that people have to hit their friends to make sure they don't miss witnessing me doing such fascinating things as walk down the same goddamned street where I've walked every fucking day for half a year.

This evening I had a woman chasing me with her toddler telling it to shout "Hallo!" but I politely ignored her and kept walking fast instead of getting stabby.  I was grudgingly impressed with their stamina.  I've been wearing my earphones all the time (often unplugged) as an excuse to ignore these people by looking like I really can't hear them.

'Cause I can't turn around and tell every single person who stares and tries to intrude on me to fuck off and swallow bleach.  The economic impact from bleach sales would have consequences on the city's economy that I'm not comfortable being responsible for.

I hadn't realized how much of this there was until being in HK where there's none.  Nobody cares about someone being white there, even though most people still are not.  There I didn't feel responsible for being a representative Canadian because if I was a jerk anyone'd be able to meet  other Canadians who weren't.  Here I just have to be nice or relegate all foreigners to being fuckwits for a lot of the people I meet.

The tension is mounting.

And it doesn't help that I'm also fighting an unrelated war of attrition against mercury vapour lighting.  I hate its orangey-ness so much.  So much.
