Quick.  Name a person less suitable than me for a gloomy Chinese student looking for advice to talk to.  Hermann Goering jumps to mind.  Or the Donald.  (I've been checking out the episode summaries of the new season of the Apprentice and they're actually more fun than watching the show was.  And quicker.)  
  
I had dinner with Alex tonight.  Supposedly I'm a good influence on him.  The other foreigners in Wanzhou are at the bar every night hooking up with girls for casual sex.  And I'm not.  
  
I put up a [new picture](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/pictures.html#xiuxi) in the pictures section here, as well as signing up for an account at [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/) where I'll toss some extras.  
Listening to: **Galactic Funk (Tau Ceti mix)** from the album Songs of a Dead Dreamer by [DJ Spooky](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22DJ Spooky%22)
