Some people might have wondered about the Jesus references on Monday.  I only got one email about it but it was an entertained email so it's all good.  I'm not explaining why I posted those or anything but I am reminded of a Calvin & Hobbes strip.  Which I'm also not going to explain.

This mildly confusing post probably shouldn't have gone up on the day I mentioned my blog to a magazine I'd like to write for, eh?  Selah.
