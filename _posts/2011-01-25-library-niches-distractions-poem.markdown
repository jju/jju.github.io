I finally got the work I wanted to get done this weekend done today. Which is fine. Monday is still part of my weekend in this term's schedule. But I can't help thinking that all of this schoolwork is distraction from doing the stuff I should be working on. I don't know. I feel like things are going along, like they're working, but that in the end I'm working towards something I am not sure if I want. 

I mean, yeah, I want to be a comics librarian, but what is that going to look like? It's not the same thing as wanting to work at a university, or even be a YA librarian. There can't be that many jobs that would be for me (which is part of why I'm so excited to do my practicum at the [Schulz Library](http://www.cartoonstudies.org/index.php/schulz-library/), it being pretty much my dream job). But if those jobs are even fewer and further between than regular library jobs then maybe I've got to be making that job myself. 

One way I could see doing that would be to turn [Librarianaut](http://librarianaut.com) into something like [Fleen](http://fleen.com). But while Fleen is journalism about webcomics, I could make a library for digital comics. Not just a directory but a research tool. Last week there were a pile of interesting reference pictures flying around Twitter from comics people. What happens when we collect those tools somewhere and make them useful for people who didn't see them on twitter? That's what a librarian is supposed to do. Improve society by giving people informational tools. I could do that for my niche (if indie digital comics can be considered my niche). I think I could.

This is what I'm thinking about tonight. I want to use these skills to make something. The way Holly [makes poetry](http://hollyrinny.blogspot.com/2011/01/sabbath-fruit.html).
