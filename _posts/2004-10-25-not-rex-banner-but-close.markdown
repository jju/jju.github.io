I feel sort of bad about something.  In all my years at school I never cared what my teachers wore.  Much less did I applaud when they wore new clothes to class.  
  
I bought a coat yesterday and both of today's classes cheered (and a group of students I met walking around) when I came into the room.  I mean, it's a nice enough coat, but really.  
  
It would be a lot easier to deal with if they really didn't like it and I had to defend it.  I'm good at that.  But cheering for a coat on a teacher?  China's weird some days.
