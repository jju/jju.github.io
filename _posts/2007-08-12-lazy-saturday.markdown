Got a bit of writing done today.  Cleaned a bit.  Ate a bit of dinner.  Wondered where the bits of time went.  
  
Also, I've been thinking about motivation a bunch lately.  For characters, especially powerful ones, the kinds of beings who could shape nations or whatever.  What would keep someone like that going?  And it gets pulled into the innerscape and I get all depressed.  
  
The novel got some extra oomph (to its concept at least) in my morning typing.  More weirdness, more grandiosity.  I think it'll play.  A lot of what I'm trying to do with this story is similar to [Crooked Little Vein](http://amazon.ca/o/ASIN/0060723939/ref=s9_asin_title_3/701-8751334-7338750?pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0VME6AA2JKRH01CCPDHP&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289772101&pf_rd_i=915398), which I really enjoyed.  Warren Ellis said wasn't his magnum opus, just his little black book.  That's a lot of what's held me back on things before, te idea of doing everything I want to do.  That's not what this book is about.
