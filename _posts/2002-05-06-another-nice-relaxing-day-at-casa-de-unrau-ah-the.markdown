Another nice relaxing day at Casa de Unrau (ah the wonderful hybridity of Spanish and German.  Doesn't it roll off the tongue like so many sourly stimulated salivary secretions?).  Read a bit of the Wind Up Bird Chronicle, watched some baseball and then went down to Campaign to play some Unknown Armies.  What's that you say?  It's a roleplaying game which is infinitely cooler than Dungeons and Dragons (which does have an actual positive cool value because of its mention in that Weezer song, so no saying "zero times infinity is still zero"), who's tagline is "When this many people are hungry for power, you'd better be the one with the fork,"  that has made me a fan of the game designers as writers from their game fiction (which if you've read any game fiction you'd know is really hard to do.  [Because most game fiction sucks.]).  It's a postmodern popcultural apocalypse, people.  But I digress.  We didn't actually play because Chris is a dickhead and didn't show up and didn't call and we couldn't get a hold of him.  So instead of playing out the end of the world as seen by the denizens of a trailer park in Arizona (in a scenario entitled "And I Feel Fine") I sat around listening to the three other guys discuss the legalities of purchasing butterfly knives and nunchakus, and who they knew and who they'd fought and so forth.  Kind of a let down.  But tomorrow we go see Rohinton Mistry.  I'm going to get him to sign my hardcover (and four years pre-Oprah's fucking Book Club thank you very much) edition of A Fine Balance, and Kate plans on seducing him.  Good times.
