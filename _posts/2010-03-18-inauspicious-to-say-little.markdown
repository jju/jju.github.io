Sinatra and Kittenoh’s relationship has begun poorly. Anne and I each held our cats and they got each other’s attention. Then Sinatra started hissing and growling and yowling and Kittenoh eventually hissed back. We deemed it a failure and withdrew. Sinatra is hissing mad at me still, twenty minutes later. It’s been a hard day for her. Maybe this is too much to ask of her. I might have to find her a new home.
