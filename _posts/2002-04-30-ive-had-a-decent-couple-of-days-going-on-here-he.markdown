I've had a decent couple of days going on here (here being "in the vicinity of my body").  Saturday night a party at Kate's for her 22nd birthday.  Sunday morning I taught Sunday school (watched the baseball X-Files episode) and did children's story (from [The Little Prince](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156012197/qid=1020144923/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_71_1/102-1686320-9036922), the chapter he visits the planet with the reasonable monarch).  Sunday night my mom made a bigass dinner (three different main courses so all the people with various dietary restrictions had options) for Dave's family and Kate and me.  Then we had yet another church event in the evening for senior high youth and we watched and discussed [Fight Club](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0137523).  I had to talk Nathan (our youth pastor) into doing it (I've been pushing for this for months) and had to talk him through his cold feet about doing it, but it went really well and we had a really good discussion with the youth afterwards.  Then Dave and the Rev and I went to Dave's and built the best fire I've ever been a part of.  One match.  And we played with plastic bags and the alien bomb-noise game, and burned buckets of wood and tables with sodden cardboard boxes full of wood on them.  It was all good.  The pit was so nice and full of shimmering coals at the end.  Mmmm.

So today was my second last day before I become employed again and I am not looking forward to it.  I am doing lawncare stuff for the summer and I have to bike a metric assload of pedals to my boss' house every morning by 8:30, and I don't even really need the money.  My EI plan would have been much better, but enough people would have been disgusted with me for doing it (see: my mother, Kate and Sean.  Ren, Hassie and Alison seemed to be all over it) that it would have been more hassle than it was worth.  It was a pleasant (no, more than pleasant, let's say Really Fucking Good [you can replace that with Really Ass-Fuckingly Good if you're[ into that sort of thing](http://seangiesbrecht.blogspot.com)]) day marred by one disappointment.  Slept late and when I showered, hot wet woodsmoke escaped my skin and filled the bathroom.  My (mom's) copy of the [ Canadian Mennonite](http://www.canadianmennonite.org/) came in the mail and those who care and have access can read a 900 word article by me within its pages on the importance of watching cool movies as Mennonites.  It's really too short a piece to cover four movies, but that's what they asked for, so don't blame me.  If I'd had my way, this one would have been part one of a series, and would have been 900 words on Fight Club.  Now after my short story that was in the Manitoban in February and this article, all I need to do is actually get paid for putting fingers to keyboard and getting something written in a forum that people don't get for free.  I don't know why I need to do this exactly, but it seems a good next step.  Then down to school to check on marks and to find a project that I want back, where I suffered my slight disappointment when one of my marks was a notch lower than I'd expected.  Lesson: don't start believing in yourself; you'll just be disappointed.  But it's amazing how spending the rest of the day with the girl you love wipes that disappointment away.  We saw [ Chunhyang](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0245837) (Why the fuck can I not spell this at all?  I spent two hours reading the character's name in the subtitles but now I can't see it at all.  Sorry.), the Korean film down at cinematheque and it was beautiful.  It's narrated by this guy singing with a drum and it draws everything out (in the stretching kind of way) in such a distinctive way.  If you see it you'll know what I mean.  The story is ridiculously traditional (High class guy and low class girl have forbidden marriage; he has to leave for the sake of politics; she remains faithful to him unto the point of death [at the hands of a vicious new governor] which he returns and rescues her from.) which lets you just watch it for its beauty, which is substantial.

I picked up the [Hanky Panky ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002AZD/qid=1020144471/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-1686320-9036922)CD by The The.  What a great disc.  It's The The doing Hank Williams songs and it's amazingly good.  Shaun Vincent (my old manager at [Campaign Outfitters](http://www.aratar.mb.ca/main.stm)) had it and I used to listen it to death, and now it's mine.

Okay (okay!) that's it for now.
