Today, moments after I hung up from Skyping with my mom, I found a job I really want. I mention Skyping with my mom because in that conversation I'd been talking about how when I graduate I'll be looking for work all over the place, and how one of the upsides of being unattached is being able to be mobile, and all that jazz, but also how I'd only try working in the U.S. if it was a great job. We talked about places I'd be more or less interested in. At no point in this conversation did Alaska come up. 

Of course, Alaska is where this job I found is.

But I think I'd be a pretty excellent [New Media Producer](http://www.ktoo.org/job-opening-new-media-producer/) for the Juneau NPR affiliate. Here's a snippet of the job description:

<blockquote>... an individual with experience and skills in journalism and online content management, including writing and editing for the web, graphic design and site management.</blockquote>

I could completely do that. And do that really well. And it would actually integrate my journalism side with my digital librarianish side (you know, content management kinds of things).

Anyway, I'm putting together an application for them. It's probably a bit of a long shot (I am a foreigner and all), and it'd mean I'd have to finish my MLIS with a couple of web-delivered courses (which wouldn't be a big deal), but it could be neat.

_Sorry this didn't happen an hour before you called, Mom. I might have been more excitable._
