Paul Auster's The Red Notebook is a short collection of true stories. I read through it speedily and then reread it. It's about things that feel like fiction but aren't. Strange coincidences and how uncanny they feel. The piecing together of your life and perception of it. On the back it talks about it as "a manifesto of fiction without theory, just pure storytelling." Of course the manifesto part only would come up because of the title, but it's hard to think Auster wasn't conscious of that when he gave it the title. All these subtle bits to it. Highly excellent.
