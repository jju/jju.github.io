We're here and it is below zero. There is snow on the ground and when I bike it is cold on my fingers. I don't have a mount on my mountain bike for a headlight so I got a ride in today. Tomorrow I might be able to use the 'cross bike again.

For whatever reason I felt this was a good time to revamp the blog. To strip it down and rehost it and get into the guts a bit more. So it's less pretty. Apologies. I know no one reads it anyway.
