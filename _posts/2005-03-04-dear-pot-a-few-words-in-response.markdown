Okay.  I think it's crappy that the US gets to name itself the human rights cop that gets to say who's naughty and nice.  Planks and specks and things.  But when China is talking about the [Human Rights Record of the US in 2004](http://gnn.tv/headlines/1284/Human_Rights_Record_of_the_US_in_2004) there's something wrong.  I'm not saying that as a form of emphasis for how shitty the US is.  Far from it.  I'm just saying that when China publishes something like this you have to be careful in saying "Way to go China!" (as the intro to the story in the link says) since the hypocrisy is even more pungent and even fewer Chinese citizens are going to call bullshit on it.

That was one thing I loved in Hong Kong.  At the ferry terminal to the island for a couple of days there were a bunch of Falun Dafa activists with their signs up saying how good it was and how their followers are tortured on the mainland.  It felt so right to be there looking at these artists' renderings of torture and angry posters denouncing Jiang Zemin.  Yes it's counter propaganda that is probably distorting the truth as well but it's something that I would fall over in shock with if I saw it in Wanzhou.  Or Chongqing.  Or Beijing.  I damn near did in Hong Kong.  Then I remembered where I was.

People sometimes get too short sighted and forget that even with all the shittiness and hypocrisy that is part of US politics they get the chance to bitch about the media not covering it.  Which is really good.  Not that people don't bitch about the media here.  I'm sure some people do, but I've never had the chance to hang out with them.

Yeah, that "Way to go China!" really bugged me.  Plus all the Chinese English phrases in the text itself, but that's more of a teaching issue I think.
