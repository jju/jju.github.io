I've had a decent week so far.  I found myself a story for my TV assignment.  I got through a write-to-pictures assignment that I hated not being able to re-edit.  Luckily we only had 2.5 hours to do it.  My friend had some problems with the deadline and the software and the stress but we got her through it.  And for being a calming influence she bought me a Canada Day beer.  Canada Day fireworks here weren't bad, a lot closer and lower than the Winnipeg ones seem.

I saw XMen2, and really liked that X3 is set up for a (hugely) simplified version of the Phoenix Rising saga (or whatever that Jean Grey/alien plotline is actually called).  And I liked that Hank McCoy was on TV in that shitty bar scene.  And Nightcrawler rocked.  Also, I bought Gangster No. 1 so all I have left to buy so everything in my DVD collection is connected is Storytelling.

Next Sunday and Monday will be tons of shooting for me.  Sunday night I'm doing the camera work for a story on a diving competition.  Monday morning is the World Juniors of DiscGolf, which I'm producer/reporter on.  Monday afternoon I'm in charge of sound for a story on this new seniors centre.  Then it'll be a big chunk of time in edit suites so we can get the 60 second stories together and beautiful.  But I'll be done my story by Friday when I go back to Folk Fest.  Which means I won't have to do any real work once I get back, leaving plenty of recuperation time.
