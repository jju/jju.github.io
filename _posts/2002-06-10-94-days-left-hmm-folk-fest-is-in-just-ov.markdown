Hmm . . . Folk Fest is in just over a month.  Anyone have a tent they'd lend me?  Last year was my first time at the big show, and I must admit that at the time I thought "Well, this isn't bad, but it's not spectacular."  Now, though I just can't wait to go again, and I'm unsure whether I'm idealizing my mieh kind of time from last year or if it's just a matter of not wanting to miss out on what everyone else having a good time, or if I've just got expectations to play around with now.Hooray for rain!  I don't have to work tomorrow, so I can get all sorts of stuff done.  Or sleep.
