Every once in a while I think "Hmm. I kind of like the library. Maybe I should go back to school and get an MLIS degree and actually become a librarian." This happened yesterday when I was working with an LSA3 who just graduated from Dalhousie in May. He's in line to be Branch Head at either our library or The Sticks, but the word on the street is he won't be coming to Intrepid. But yes, some days I think about going back to school and doing this.

Then I am reminded why this job is just a paycheque.

Today Targ emailed me about the storytime themes for the winter session. We'd had to submit these things weeks ago because we aren't allowed to print our own fliers for some arcane reason. Her email said she'd received a phone call from the head of Youth Services saying two of my storytime theme titles were inappropriate. The email was to let me know Targ and Karin changed those titles.

Guess what the inappropriate storytime themes were. Guess. I dare you. If your guess included any words beginning with F, S, C, N or K you are wrong. Not even close. 

My inappropriate themes were "Demanding Dinosaurs" and "Royalty and Romance."

Let's begin with the second one, which is going to be run two days before Valentine's Day. "Romance is not something that is appropriate for children 3-5," went the objection. "First time storytime parents might be offended. We will change the theme to Hugs & Kisses." Because people would much rather leave their children with a bearded guy telling them Hugs and Kisses stories. I'd finally be able to use that white windowless van puppet we've got kicking around. I countered by explaining the stories were about princes and princesses and a lot of them involve living happily ever after by turning into frogs after a kiss with your Princess Charming. I'm doing the Paper Bag Princess and other stories to subvert the damsel in distress theme for that one. I asked, "How about we call it 'In Pursuit of the Practically Perfect Princess'?" I liked that because of the play on Practical. Karin did not. "It will be called 'Princes and Princesses.'"

"Demanding Dinosaurs" was offensive because of the word "Demanding." "It is too strong and harsh," said this voice of bureaucracy. "Being mindful of the language we choose to include in our publications for customers is an important responsibility." Actually, she said that last bit in response to the part in my email where I wrote how this was pretty ridiculous. Being mindful of language? Dude, that is why it was called Demanding Dinosaurs! Have you ever seen a Tyrannosaurus? They demand a lot of stuff, not least of which is your attention and respect. Plus the word works on the level of people demanding dinosaurs. Our storytime crowd is mostly boys. Boys demand dinosaurs. It was the perfect word, chosen because I am so fucking mindful of language. Being mindful of language is all I do.* She changed it to "Terrific Dinosaurs." Who the fuck is mindful of language now? That's not alliterative at all! I suggested "Diggable Dinosaurs" instead, even though there is a grand total of one story we might do that has buried dinosaurs in it, and 6 that have real live dinos that demand things. I am the bigger person, making a goddamned compromise of my artistic vision. Which is okay because really, artistic vision? In picking a theme for preschool kids who don't give a shit and are just there for a bit of entertainment anyway? I can live with compromise in this arena.

I did not email Karin back after her "mindful of language" email. Snark would have overpowered me and I would have asked for the full list of words that were inappropriate for Storytime. "No Demanding, but can we Ask? Or must we Request? Or shall everything be engraved invitations. I expect there's no more use of Holler or Shout or Yell, only Whispers." Yeah, it would have gone on and on. I restrained myself and let them call my storytimes their compromise words.

If I ever became a librarian, I'd have to deal with those humourless bureaucratic schlubs as equals instead of fodder to write and laugh about. That would be a shame.

* As an aside, a couple of nights ago I got into an argument with Sri about the Social Sciences, and was getting pissed off when he wouldn't listen to a word I was saying, so because I am so mindful of language I used the term Physical Science when I was talking all non-Social stuff. He's a biologist and my calling his work Physical was calculated to piss him off. He did stop to correct me every time I used it, which was the only way I knew I was making any sound. He would not accept the fact that we were using differing definitions for the word science, and not expecting this debate to come up, I didn't have the examples at hand to show him what I meant. I left the table before I could get mad.
