I've realized that our time in Oz is coming to an end. It was the placard-toting vigilantes that finally clued me in. 

Right now the plan is that Holly goes travelling in Australia by herself for a while when she quits her job, and then heads over to New Zealand to visit Catherine, a friend we know from China. Because of my incessant and pitiful whining on the subject she's shifted things around so I can come to NZ the day I finish work and go hiking with them on [the Milford Track](http://www.milfordtrack.net/). I'll only get a week in Middle Earth (and on the South Island so no trips to Hobbiton) but that's way better than being down here and not going to visit the Canada of the south Pacific (a phrase which garners curiously few Google hits, and one of them referred to Australia).

One of the great pities of living here has been the lack of oven in our apartment. If you live with a baker, be very sure your dwelling has one. But last week, in order to make us not want to leave (or complain about the extra rooms and people being added to the place), our landlord finally gave us a small convection oven. This is what life with a baker should be. Last night we made pizza, real pizza without having to use the "covered frying pan" technique. Holly's made biscuits and muffins and buns. She's possibly baking cookies right now. 

It's good and inspiring, this whole "eating delicious food" thing (our whole time living together, really). It'd be difficult to go back to Vancouver and not cook better for myself, even without the prod of cooking for someone else. I've been thinking about that a bit because yeah, with less than a month left before I'm unemployed, my orientation is shifting back towards Vancouver. That's how I roll, with great inertia. Things to prepare for even if you don't know what they'll look like. Amat Victoria Curam. I don't know who that'd be a victory over.
