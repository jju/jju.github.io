This [Alternet article](http://alternet.org/election04/20406/) is easily my favourite piece of writing about the election.  
  


<blockquote>Nearly 52 percent of all Americans preferred to simply ignore reality to keep their faith in God and the man who is only too happy to play messiah.   
  
This is now their White House, their Senate, their House of Representatives, and very likely their Supreme Court. It's their country. </blockquote>
