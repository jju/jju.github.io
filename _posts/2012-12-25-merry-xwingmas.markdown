In the past I loved Christmas, but being far from Winnipeg just over half the Decembers since I stopped living at home has kind of made the need to be with family and do the same things as always sort of less appealing. I like the idea of Xmas traditions and getting together with loved ones and all that, but I like it better with a bit of detachment.

I like being in a country where Xmas isn't celebrated (or is done with hitting people with inflatable bats for some reason) and having a few people you make something kind of holidayish with. Last year I got to hang out with Holly's family and I really liked it. I like seeing what other people's traditions are and fitting into them as best I can.

This year though, I didn't do anything for Xmas. Scheduling at work is crazy because 'tis the season to take time off. I didn't have many holiday days anyway, and my mom is going to India, so heading home was a bit less of a draw, since I'd have had to crash friends' family things. So here I am. I bought myself a Lego set, as that is the traditional Xmas gift in my home, wherever it may be.

And now I'm going to watch the good Star Wars movies. Merry Xmas, happy new year and I'm glad the days'll only get longer for the next few months.
