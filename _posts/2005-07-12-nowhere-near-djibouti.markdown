It's hot out, but it's not Africa hot.  Only in the mid 40s.  So what do we do?  We head to the Flaming Mountains to make the most of the experience.  In _Journey to the West_ the mountains here were literally on fire and the Monkey King had to steal an iron fan to put them out.  Or something like that.  I always get the Monkey King stories and Hanuman all mixed up so forgive me all you Chinese scholars.  
  
We took the train from Kashgar out here after a sort of disappointing Sunday Market.  It was big.  And eventually busy.  But not really crazy the way we'd pictured.  We did buy stuff though, and we will never ever ever mention how much we paid for any of it.  My main purchase was a Kashgarian hat, which looks suspiciously European, but it's very authentic.  This is the hat that about 35% of the males in Kashgar wear.  I could have brought my prayer hat from Egypt and fit right in.  
  
The train was more stressful than the one out to Kashgar because we were opposite a family with many brattish dependents.  I had great schadenfreude when the older boy's open Pepsi spilled all over their lower bunk (and not my notebook and me).  But then I felt bad because the mom chewed out the dad for not springing into action, which was understandable because he was asleep on the top bunk.  
  
Tomorrow night we'll take a short train trip (12 hour) to Dunhuang.  Really, we might as well walk that kind of distance.  
  
Holly's out watching a Uighur (we've decided on the Weeger pronunciation) dance show, but I saw a short one this afternoon and that was about all I needed.  Dancing just doesn't do it for me.  Especially when they're doing it for tourists and not afficionados.  Have you read _The Sun Also Rises_ recently?  I am not an aficionado.  Not everyone can be.  
  
Now I'll go have a beer.  You know there's something right with the world when beer and coke are the same price.
