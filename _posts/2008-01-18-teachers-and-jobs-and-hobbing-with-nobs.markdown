Yesterday at work I saw my grade four teacher. She saw me first, which is on the weird side. I'm trying to think of the last time I'd have seen her (maybe grade eight?) and I look different than I did then damnit. I'm sure I do. I did not have a beard back then. She said she thought she knew "those eyes" but really. Come on now. She was collecting material for grade four science projects. I called her Miss Bergen while we talked. I can get away from that for all the high school teachers but not a chance for elementary school.

Still no word on whether I'm getting my leave or quitting at the end of February. Jeff said that if I am granted the leave he'll get me to start training as an LSA, which would be nice. Do a bit more than bookstacking. If I get to keep this job. If I don't well, there are other options.

I did an online application for one of the big Teach English in Japan companies (chosen based on recommendation by someone who's worked with them before) and they've asked me to send them a resume. I'll do that. They only interview in Vancouver or Toronto though. If I have to leave the library I'll be able to justify flying out to one of those places I guess.
