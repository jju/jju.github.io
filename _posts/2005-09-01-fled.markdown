I'm in the new apartment, the internet works and all is well with the world.
  

  
Except for the part of the world that decided to take my little "treat the old apartment as a horribly failed relationship" bit and threw in a last nasty surprise to really seal the deal.
  

  
At about midnight, after putting the finishing touches on my packing, I headed into my room to hit the old horse fodder.  Where I saw above my headboard a big fat spider.  Not as big as the last one in the bathroom but big enough.
  

  
You may expect another gripping tale of heroism in the face of this fresh assault.  Ha!  I treated this spider like I would if it were one last problem, a final argument if you will, in my relationship with the apartment; I ran.
  

  
Not quickly.  I just turned around, put on my shoes and went for a nice midnight stroll.  The idea was for the spider to have time to migrate wherever it wanted to that wasn't visible to me.
  

  
When I returned (and I wish I'd brought my camera because there was an astounding picture opportunity I missed) the spider was nowhere to be seen.  I then got into bed (after shaking out the blankets) as far away from the last known position of the arachnid as possible.  And tried to sleep.
  

  
Which didn't work too well, but hey.
