I was going to write a really big thing tonight and have a long quotation and it was going to be really great.  But instead I got caught up in rearranging my room to accommodate my mom's new computer and then realized that I had another article to write for the Canadian Mennonite that was only a half assed first draft that I'd be ashamed to post on the blog let alone get paid for (that's right!  I'm getting paid for writing up a carwash!  Fucked up and weird, but hey, I like shovelling snow.  You know, cultural snow [name the reference and get a big shiny no-prize.]).  So now I'm too tired because . . . actually I'd rather sleep than explain so I'll leave you with another quote (and the possibility of another no-prize): "If you loved me, you'd all kill yourselves today."  Toodles!
