Yesterday was a crazy nice day, so I went out walking.  I've become quite a fan of Portage Avenue.  Walking along it at least.  I've been looking for some sort of really good picture from downtown and I just can't put my finger on any.  Like, a picture that's all "Hey, this is Winnipeg!"  I put a few up on Flickr that don't do that (though I do like the light from last week).  Whatever.  Sorry.  Random.
