I just returned from an evening of hotpot and drinking with the top PR cop in Wanzhou.  Strange times.  
  

  
But the important thing is that I just killed another cockroach in my kitchen.  I stomped on it to an unreasonable degree so there is no question that it is dead.  If it has disappeared in the morning we will all know that the roaches have developed their own advanced society and will destroy us all by triggering a US-NoKo nuclear situation.  If it is still there we are safe.
  

  
Unless they've learned about blogging.
