I'm poking around looking for good library blogs, as I've applied to library school for September, and it seems like a good idea to get in the heads of people in the profession. This looks like the group I was born to be a part of: [The Society for Librarians* Who Say Motherfucker](http://community.livejournal.com/library_mofo/). Someday. For now I'll content myself with being a regular dude who says motherfucker. To my mom's chagrin.

Unrelated to motherfuckers, I got Excel to do something fun today. A person had a list of 12,000 numbers and was looking for the ones that only occurred on the list once. He was going through the list by hand deselecting everything that recurred, and it made me sad. So I said, "I will help you. Let me muck about in Excel and figure out a way to get that shit sorted, yo." And I completely did. It wasn't perfect (I had to check the first and last entry on the list by hand) and it wasn't elegant (it took like four separate columns in the spreadsheet) but I made Excel do the shit I wanted and it saved a person from (and was faster than) deselecting 10,000 things from a list. Go me.

Also, we had a condo corporation meeting I was dreading all day. But it happened and now I don't have to think about it for a while. Tomorrow I am going to sleep in and get some real things accomplished. Yes.
