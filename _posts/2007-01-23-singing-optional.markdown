I have a plan.  By the time I go see Kid Koala (tomorrow night!) I'll be done something.  My script _Tradition_ is most likely to see the completion party, since it's only got a page and a bit left.  This is an important plan for me, because it's been a lot of scattered work on too many things recently, which meant that not a lot actually happened.  
  
This is not a new phenomenon.  I have four different beginnings to one story kicking around.  Not just versions in different states, but completely different things that are up to a few thousand words long.  It's frustrating.
