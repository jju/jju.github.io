My new apartment is so many millions of times better than my old one I can't even begin to tell you.  Which is why I won't.  Ha!

No, that's not fair.

From where I sit I can see the Yangtze river.  During the day my apartment gets light in it from the out of doors.  My kitchen is sit-in-able.  It is possible you know me as an inveterate kitchensitinner, but I could not indulge in that pastime in my horrible dank former apartment.  Here I can sit on the ample counter space and watch people go by below.

I've optimized my living room for videogames/movie watching  for about four people.  More people mean that electronic diversions may not work and we may need to resort to speech and conversation.  The horror.

I have pictures up and hooks for my coats.  Life is sweet.

Of course classes start on Monday and I'm only notionally prepared for that.
