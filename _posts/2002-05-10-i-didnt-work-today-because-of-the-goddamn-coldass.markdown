I didn't work today because of the goddamn coldass godsemen that has been spewed all over us in fits of raging ecstasy at the wondrous power to fuck with people that is inherent in being, well omnipotent.  So I read.  Last night I finished the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (which I really like because it's tone really changes as the book goes on, but you get more points of view and yeah I'm inarticulate on the subject Fuck me in the ass with a big white frozen cock if you care) and this morning I read South of the Border, West of the Sun, which is perhaps my least favourite Murakami book even though it's got all this great stuff about being an only child.  Now I'm rereading Sputnik Sweetheart and when I'm finished that (tomorrow morning if my boss deems it too wet to work) I'm going to reread the Brothers K so I can talk about it intelligently with Dave when he's done.
  

  
Okay, so here's my question, my fodder for discussion:  If you were a character in a novel (or a short story, whatever), who would have written it?  For instance I know I'm not a Hemingway character, and I'm not quite fanciful enough to be a Salman Rushdie hero.  I could be a sort of minor cousin in a Tim Powers novel, but nothing that much space would be wasted on.  Not funny enough to be by Pratchett, not enough joie de vivre to be by de Bernieres, not tough enough to be by Ellroy.  For me I'd say I'd have to be written by either Murakami or Douglas Adams, depending on how bleak my view of the universe is on a particular day.  They both write ordinary people that have weird (or funny) things happen to them, and especially in the Murakami stuff I see a lot of me.  I think that my character would be by Murakami, but the dialogue would be Adams on a day that he's hepped up on NyQuill (and isn't dead) so he isn't at his sharpest.  But that's just me.  Has anyone else ever thought about this?
