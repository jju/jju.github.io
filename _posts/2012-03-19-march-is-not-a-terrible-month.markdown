It was my birthday last week though I didn't do anything special for it. Earlier in the week I went to see [Fred Penner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Penner) perform at UBC. I went with library school classmates and afterwards Jamie and Nicholle got him to sign their ukeleles. I didn't join in the picture taking because I've seen Fred Penner in enough situations over the years where he's just another guy (high school, Quinzmas, church) that treating him like a celebrity seemed weird.

Getting close to being done my homework for the term. My best assignment is undoubtedly my book trailer (see above) but I've had a few other things to finish as well. I saw a sentence on my Twitterfeed the other day saying "If you aren't doing something you love, you're wasting your time" In no way did I feel I was wasting my time making that video. The rest of my homework is not quite so inspiring.

I've applied for a job in New York to be a librarian at [DC Comics](http://www.dccomics.com/), which would be crazy neat. It'd be a special library where I'd help research the first appearance of minor characters and do interlibrary loans with the studios in Burbank. It'd be a bit different from being a teen librarian but it'd be all sorts of cool. Probably won't get it, but would have kicked myself for ages if I hadn't applied.

And it gave me a reason to talk to people at the comic publisher booths when Jamie and I head down to [Emerald City Comic Con](http://emeraldcitycomicon.com) in a couple of weeks. I wonder what kind of library a place like [Oni](http://www.onipress.com/) or [Dark Horse](http://www.darkhorse.com/) has, and how they get used. I'm the kind of person who can't just go up to people and start talking, but having a real question I'd like to answer will be a way to kick myself into it.
