I bought a bigger memory card for my camera today.  128MB gets me 89 pictures at 2048x1536px.  Mmm pictures.    
  
I've got my streaming CBC Radio One going without having to get Windows Media Player, so I'll have audio to go with my websearching on the US election results tomorrow morning.  I'll probably get up early so I can keep up with it all day, or however many weeks it takes for them to bring the decision to Rehnquist's hospital bed.  
  
People don't just get in trouble for taking pictures in China.  Check out this story from the election [down in Florida](http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/news/epaper/2004/11/01/m1a_Henry_1101.html).
