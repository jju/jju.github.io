Someday I hope to learn that using my phone as a wordprocessor is a delicate thing, and I cannot expect perfect functionality out of such a device.  I forgot that this morning when I decided to check a shortcut combination without saving immediately beforehand.  I mean I thought "I wonder if Command X will cut that bit?" and immediately tried it.  Needless to say my phone crashed and I lost my morning's work.  Sad but useful.  
  
I also spent a good chunk of the day arguing strenuously with Steve the cat about whether today was an appropriate day for him to venture out of doors.  He said it was, repeatedly.  I disagreed.  At one point I opened the door so he'd shut the hell up about the issue.  In my head, he would take two steps outside, realize it was not cat weather and come back in.  He didn't.  He ran off down the street.  Rather than explain to Alison why her cat only had one ear when she returned I went out to grab him and bring him back inside.  Steve the cat is an idiot and would stay out there, freezing his paws/ears/pretty-much-everything-but-his-torso off just to be a bad cat.  He was already walking funny after about a hundred seconds.  I locked him in Alison's room for the better part of the day.
