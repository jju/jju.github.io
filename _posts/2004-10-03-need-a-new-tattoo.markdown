Being the ignorant foreigner has its advantages.  Such as when security officials are trying to get you to stop videotaping the cleanup from a minor student revolt in the dorms.  You smile, nod and go on filming until they start waving their hands in your lens.  Then it's hard to fake it.  So you find a different angle from a different location.  
  
At 11:30 a lot of yelling started in the dorms.  I'm in bed.  After some debate I grab my videocamera and go see if I could see what the shouting was about.  
  
I get outside and head towards the nearest dorm.  There are crowds of maybe 5-10 students in the public balconies on each floor of the eightish storey building . . .  
  
Digression.  I just (12:31am) got off the phone with the assistant waiban, Miss Wang.  I'm sorry she got woken up to call me because I went out and was curious, but I'm supposed to go in tomorrow to discuss what was going on.  I'll come back to this later.  
  
So students are on the balconies and I hear building cheers after crashes.  On the ground below are a bunch of smashed bottles and three large broken chair-like things.  It doesn't take long to realize that people are throwing things from on high.  I think I saw people on the roof, but it could have been from windows.  Then another bottle lands.  And I hear a big smash and cheer from the north side of the building.    
  
I tape for a while.  A couple of things landed in my direction, which was far from the courtyard where most stuff I could see was going.  I decide to head around to see what is happening on the north side.  I get there in time to see something explode as it's landing on the ground.  I think I got in on tape.  The road on this side is strewn about with garbage.  Mostly broken bottles and such.  
  
I tape from a couple more angles, and see a big plant get tossed off a balcony.  As I'm shifting again, I come across about eight men in military style uniforms heading in the opposite direction.  They head into the dorm and patrolled through the halls.  I could see them on one floor just walking through.  
  
Things had quieted down and all the balconies were cleared when people come out to start cleaning up.  They have garbage bags and are dragging away the big stuff.  While that's going on three uniforms come up to me and say bu yao (don't want) a bunch, which is where this post began.  
  
Miss Wang just wants to explain that some of the students are upset that the winter schedule starts this week.  She wants to make sure that foreign teachers understand what's going on.  I suppose a uniform called Mr. Pu (the waiban), and he called her who called me.  I think it's funny how quick the message came out of the office.  
  
This is the first time I ever felt like I had any power with anything I wrote/filmed.  Yay for journalism.
