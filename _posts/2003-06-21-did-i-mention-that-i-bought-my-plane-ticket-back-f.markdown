Did I mention that I bought my plane ticket back for Folk Fest?  I did.  I'll be getting into the peg around 4ish and then will steal my mom's car for the weekend, having to return to London on Sunday night.  People may be getting some instructions on things to buy for me (that I will reimburse them for) for Folk Fest, since I don't want to be carrying a lot of stuff with me on the plane.  It'll be funny.  I'll see my mom for maybe an hour total on my trip out.  And steal her car.
