I'm done paging. It was an uneventful final shift at Millennium. By the time I left I think most of the pages I'd ever spoken more than three words to knew I was done. And that I have no problem with people saying congratulations about.

Next week I get to delve into the world of actually answering people's questions and having to know how to work the photocopier and such. Craziness may ensue (at the very least I'll have more stuff to blog about).

And tomorrow is Alison's wedding which should be fun.
