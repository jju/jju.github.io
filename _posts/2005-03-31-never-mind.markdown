I judged a speech contest this afternoon and have no idea who won.  The parameters never make any sense.  There are no marks at all for content, just fluency and pronunciation.  I was supposed to critique them afterwards and couldn't.  Like of course it's not great English and they're lousy speeches that don't actually construct any arguments and they make all sorts of mistakes.  But which are the important ones?  I don't know.  I'm glad I don't have to teach them anything about this crap.
