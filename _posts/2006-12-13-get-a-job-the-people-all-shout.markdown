Hey, if you just can't get enough of my writing, here's something I'm doing until I get bored of it: [A Slummer in the Stacks](http://stacksburg.blogspot.com).  It's the in-character log of a Hive Primus journalist who's going down to Necromunda's Underhive and writing about the settlement of Stacksburg.  I like travel blogging, and figured it'd be fun to do that in a fictional world.  It should also give a bit more depth to some of the characters that might show up in our Necromunda games.  Importantly, it's also a world that I didn't make up.  I'm trying my hand at fitting into established universes, cause that's actually a useful skill for me to have.  For work in gaming circles.  
  
Yes, it's just gaming fiction.  Bite me.
