I uploaded a few new pictures to [my flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/) today. Most are from this past weekend so they include Dan's non-birthday and playing Settlers out by Neepawa. But there are also some cat pictures too. 

The black and white one of [Steve the cat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/2210113686/) was from this morning. He sits outside Alison's door every morning waiting for her to wake up. Today I could get a picture because Alison's sick and didn't go to work before I woke up.

Still no word on whether I get to keep my job when I get back from China.
