So Wednesday was day 0 and now we start counting up again.  Which works for me.  I suppose I should be more excited about leaving tomorrow, but it seems to be like recognizing your mortality.  You know the line from Fight Club about _knowing _not fearing that one day you will die?  It feels like that.  Tomorrow I die and in six months I will return resurrected (symbolically of course).  Now entering liminal state from which a new person will emerge.  Or maybe that's putting too much pressure on this trip, though I've been trying really hard.  There was a Japanese poet who went to find enlightenment in the savage northlands (coliseum) and when he returned he was enlightened.  His profound realization was that inner peace wasn't to be found in the savage northlands at all.  And it's easy to say that and I know that that's the kind of thing that all those texts try to teach, but fuck, sometimes you have to be a goddamned fool and look for things that aren't there.  You have to believe the lie so you're doing something that you might be able to pass off as meaningful.So buh-bye, and I won't apologize for not updating my blog very frequently in the upcoming months.  Fuck you all (and when I say that I mean it with as much love as I can muster).
