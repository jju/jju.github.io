I don't think I've seen Auld Lang Syne provoke people to go running from the sidewalk in the way I saw tonight.  Like turning a light on in my kitchen it was.  
  
You see, the street washing truck was coming along spraying water to keep the dirt down or rinse it away or whatever (I didn't see any sweeping component) and it was blaring the New Year's song as a warning to everyone who wanted to keep their pantlegs dry.  
  
Listening to: **Capture the Flag** from the album You Forgot it in People
