Neal Stephenson's [Baroque Cycle](http://www.booksprice.com/compare.do?inputData=baroque+cycle&Submit2=Search&searchType=bookName) was astoundingly good.  This is the trilogy I've been yammering on about for months now.  The one about currency and alchemy and the Enlightenment and kings and princesses and Natural Philosophers and pirates and Jesuits and true love that spans decades/fortunes/poverty/very poor decisions.  I am far richer for having read these books, which is anything anyone could ever hope for, right?
