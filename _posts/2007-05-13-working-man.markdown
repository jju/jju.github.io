Yesterday I got to be somewhat of a journalist. I called an interviewee. I talked to his assistant. I waited around for him to call me back after a meeting went long. I rescheduled an interview. On Monday I'll be even more of a journalist. It's good to remember I'm actually capable of doing all this stuff.   
  
Especially good since I'm being interviewed for the National Correspondent position at the Canadian Mennonite.  It probably sounds more impressive than it is, but I'd be doing something I've trained for to earn my living. I haven't done that since I left Campaign.
