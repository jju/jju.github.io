Wanzhou's post office has the friendliest international mail guy I've ever met.  He's young and is always doing at least eight things at once but he's been really helpful each time I've mailed things to Canada.  He always gives me a correctly filled out form to show me what I should be putting where.  He's just pleasant to deal with.  It makes it not a chore at all.  Or at least far less of a chore than finding a student to help me do it.  
  
Of course, I have no idea if the packages ever leave the post office.
