Whew.  Thank goodness for up to date backups.  My phone is back in the land of the living after I had to wipe it down to factory settings to get it to stop resetting itself.  The problem?  I think it had to do with too much information elbowing itself out of the way.  
  
I keep on coming up with ideas for writing, which is weird.  Normally it's ideas I have problems with, but the past week or two they've actually been kind of easy.  I'm a big fan.
