Dinosaur Comics are awesome.  It is impossible to get enough.  Any sentence containing the phrases "Dinosaur Comics" and "too much" is being spoken by someone who has absconded from the facility before they put the sense-making parts of the brain back in.
  

  
There are over 500 comics using the same exact art each time.  But it works, and it's beautifully clever.  T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus and Utahraptor discuss all sorts of things while T-Rex stomps on things.  It's funny because it's true.
  

  
Awesomeness example: [the dinosaurs talk about body issues](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=519).
