I'm reading a book about China right now called [Wild Swans (Jung Chang)](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385425473/qid=1085807057/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/702-4317389-0340051).  It has no mercenaries but lots of intelligence officers all fighting for Manchuria.  The empire of Manchukuo also featured in [The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Haruki Murakami)](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099448793/qid=1085806952/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/702-4317389-0340051), which of course is from a more Japanese point of view.  And a more apolitical point of view, since it focuses on the zoo, and killing the predators so they wouldn't hinder the advance of the army - I don't know which one.  I just finished reading [Life is Elsewhere (Milan Kundera)](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060997028/qid=1085807112/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_0_1/702-4317389-0340051), which has a lot of criticism for putting art in the service of politics, but then in the same breath sets itself in a hideously political environment.  I suppose that's what needs to be done, but I'm getting more and more angry with anything that seems important outside of the context of fiction.
  

  
In non-political non-artistic news, the video for my grandma is trundling along.  Nothing amazing, but there are a couple of bits that make me smile.  I need a bigger hard drive to do all this video editing on.
