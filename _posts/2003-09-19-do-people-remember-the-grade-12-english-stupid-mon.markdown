Do people remember the grade 12 english Stupid Monkeys debacle?  The title of my paper for the departmental exam showed I had a sense of humour, which they ruthlessly punished me for (before the appeal).  It is being reprised here in my internship applications.  The problem seems to come down to my resume, which includes skills that I've picked up over my lifetime.  Skills like "keeping tiny groups of people alive and organized in far off lands."  I think that's an important skill to show that I have.  I refuse to use the cliched buzzword things we were told employers look for when we had a resume writing workshop a couple of months ago.  I want my resume to be something interesting to read, not some turgid shit.  Monday I'm having a meeting with the person at Western here who has the concerns and we'll see if we can come up with a compromise.  But really, if DNTO doesn't get jokes (and not even jokey jokes, just "hey this person isn't a souldead-sack-of-flesh" kinds of things), I'm fucked.  And there's another person who applied to intern on the show.  Grr.  I'm from Winnipeg and it's the cool thing about going back to Winnipeg in January.  I want this internship.  I don't want to have to do my second or third choices.  Really.  I want something fun that I can take seriously but still get jokes at.

I think people don't realize how getting jokes doesn't mean you can't take things seriously.  It's not like I try to be a clown or anything.  I get shit done better than loads of people, but things need to be funny.  I don't know if I'd be able to do a job where I would have to sublimate any reaction to funny shit that happens.  Gahh.  What the hell am I doing?  I don't want to fit myself all coglike into an organization.  This isn't for me at all!

And deep breath, and we're okay now.
