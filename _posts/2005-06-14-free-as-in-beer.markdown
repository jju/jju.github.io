I know I've linked to RConversation before, but [RConversation: this post](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2005/06/my_response_to_.html) was really important.  
  
It's weird teaching about American Culture because I want to stress how great these freedoms we enjoy are, but it's condescending to think that Chinese people need a foreign solution (foreign examples are a different matter).  Some people are capable of taking a long view.
