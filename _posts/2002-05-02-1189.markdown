Do you want to know what to do with your life?

Sweep.

Do you want to know how to begin a new venture?

Sweep.

Do you want to clear away misconceptions?

Sweep.

Do you want to know how to be thorough?

Sweep.

Do you want to create order?

Sweep.

Do you want an antidote to your excesses?

Sweep.

Do you lack for something to do?

Sweep.

Do you worry for the future?

Sweep.

Do you strive to be grounded?

Sweep.

Do you find it difficult to meditate?

Sweep.

Do you find it hard to finish what you start?

Sweep.

Do you need a skill in life?

Sweep.

Do you worry too much?

Sweep.
