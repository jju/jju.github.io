Man, the secrets that some people keep.  Months down the line I finally get an email mentioning that [Holly's been blogging since February](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hollyrinny).  So if you want to read about an English teacher in China who, you know, does things that are worth writing about instead of just riffing on webcomics, check it out.  She has friends and things like that.  
  
While I'm at it, Jesse Epp-Fransen, who goes to the same church as me back in Peg City, is also in China and [writing about it](http://spaces.msn.com/members/jeppfransen/PersonalSpace.aspx), though his posts behave more like the group emails they originated as.  
  
Now I'm feeling bad about how crappy my blogging has been recently.  Video games?  Basketball on TV?  Canadianisms?  I apologize heartily.  And I haven't put a new picture up in weeks.  But all my picture ideas right now have been more on the weird abstractions you find in the sidewalk tiles that are going to bore you.  
  
I'll do better, I promise.
