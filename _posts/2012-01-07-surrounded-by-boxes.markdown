My first week back at school is done. I still have to have my first Management class on Monday night, and a bunch of meetings that'll determine how my term'll go, but it's been pretty okay.

I got my rental bond refund from the Sydney apartment today so that was nice. There'd been a lot of back and forth with our landlord's rental agent that had been giving me worries. I know that his parasitic trying to worm an extra hundred dollars out of me while telling me he'd my friend is just his job, but man, does that kind of stuff get me angry. I needed him to sign a form so I could get the bond money back, but he said he couldn't do it so he'd get the landlord to do it that afternoon and fax it in. A week later I had to call him again to find out why it hadn't been done and then there were stories of papers getting lost and blah blah blah. I really didn't want to get mad about the money, but it's a big enough sum to cover two months of my Vancouver rent.

I hate getting mad about things like that. I mean, I knew I was in the right, and the agent wasn't doing his job well (or was trying to pull something). But just being right doesn't mean much at all. I used to be better at dealing with that kind of thing. I think. The condo broke me, made me so unhappy and paranoid when it comes to those kinds of matters. I can still feel it here, like something's going to happen and I'm going to have to move all my stuff out of this apartment (which I quite like).

All of that to explain why my room still looks like I'm living out of a suitcase. It's hard to know how much unpacking and settling to do here. I might be staying a long time, but maybe I won't. In Sydney I lived out of two carryon bags for eight months (the amount of time I have left in this degree), so all the crap strewn about already seems wasteful, and that's with only one bookcase taken out of storage. But the more you settle  in the crappier the moving on later is.
