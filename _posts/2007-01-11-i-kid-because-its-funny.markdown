[![](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/memberimages/030711.png)](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/memberimages/030711.png)I think this was my first [le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink) that came directly from real life experiences.  Experiences with Terry Fox.  Or possibly with sitting around at the King's Head waiting for some jackass to go back to Mozambique.  I don't usually cross-post my comics but I've gotten a good reaction to this one already, and more people read the blog than the comic, so there you go.  
  
Do you want to learn more about Terry Fox (or possibly Steve Fonyo)?  Here's [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terry_fox).    
  
Do you want to read the best Terry Fox related story ever?  [My friend Caroline has it right here.](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com/2005/09/misunderstood-youth.html)
