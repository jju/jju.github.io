I was planning on an indepth analysis of a couple of lines from a Buck 65 song that really resonated on my way downtown tonight.  There were also plans to talk about Ning Hua's strange radio show and his conceptions of Canadian society.

Revenge of the Sith hit stores today.  I walked in as the guy was unloading the boxes.  Tonight (in the centre of my small self-centred universe) all the Jedi are going to die.
