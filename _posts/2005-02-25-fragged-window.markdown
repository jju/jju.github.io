I've started [Kafka on the Shore](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400043662/qid=1109134426/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-7085229-0639062) but I'm doing my best not to drown myself in it too quickly.  I read a chapter or two then do something else, play some video games or go see if the English Department is open to give me my schedule for next week, whatever.  
  
To tell the truth, I'm scared of this book.  
  
It appeared out of nowhere, completely unlike all the previous Murakami books, which I've dutifully waited for until they came out in paperback.  It's the first I read a review of before I'd read the book, and now I know why James never ever ever wants to know anything in advance about what he consumes media-wise.  
  
Not that the review was bad or spoiled anything (it basically said "not as good as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"), but Murakami has been _my_ favourite author and the fact that other people knew about this and have read and reviewed it before me while I'm way out here in China irks me.  It shouldn't.  I bought his last book in India and there was no irking going on.  
  
He's using a different kind of narrator this time which is adding to my worries.  Normally his novels have a narrator who is in his 30s and is letting life have its way with him.  The eponymous Kafka in this book is a 15 year old runaway.  There is something interesting about the narrator.  He isn't someone we have to learn to appreciate, he's much more obvious as a protagonist.  But he sometimes still sounds like the rest of the bokus.  
  
Maybe I should stop taking these breaks to think and just read straight through to the end.  That might help me put my perspective together.
