Sometimes I forget just what it's like to read a book I really enjoy.  Since I don't have the same freedom of choice that I do in Canada I've been reading stuff I normally wouldn't.  Sometimes that works out all right, like The Scarlet Letter, which was way more interesting and engagingly written than I'd assumed it would be.  Sometimes it goes poorly.
  

  
I've been working on Solzhenitsyn's book The Gulag Archipelago and it's been shaking my faith in my love of reading.  I mean, I know this is a really important book.  And that it's good.  I mean, he's got a wry humour about what's happening to everyone under Stalin that makes it way better than a mere history book.  But I hate reading it.  It's a chore.
  

  
Reading has never been a chore.  The main reason is that when I don't like a book I can usually put it aside and read something else.  It took three starts to do both War and Peace and The Brothers Karamazov, two for Gravity's Rainbow, and The Idiot.  But eventually I really enjoyed all those books.  The lack of other options to this book I'm plodding through has been making the reading of it that much worse and more worrisome.  Has China dulled my brain so much that I can't enjoy books?
  

  
But last night Margie gave me the pair of Hemingway books she had on her shelves.  I read The Sun Also Rises this afternoon and my faith in literature was restored.  My brain still loves books.  The ones it likes, anyway.  Tomorrow is A Farewell to Arms and then I might have had enough of a palate cleansing to finish the Gulag before leaving on Friday.
