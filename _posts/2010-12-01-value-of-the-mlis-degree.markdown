We've talked in class about the image of the librarian, which well, whatever. I don't really care about professionalism and all that bullshit. It reeks of snobbery and hiding behind dehumanizing rules. I do believe in providing the best possible service I can, but on my terms. Whatever. So the question comes up about whether you need the degree to be a librarian. And conversely whether the people with degrees should be on the reference desk or helping fix the printers.

So it's possible to address this situation and [sound a little privileged and snotty about it](http://agnosticmaybe.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/the-masters-degree-misperception/). The thing I dislike about that Agnostic Maybe article is that somehow helping people damages the professional image of a librarian, since it's the kind of thing people without an advanced degree could do. Fuck that.

Happily, that post [spawned responses](http://shelfcheck.blogspot.com/2010/09/response-to-masters-degree.html), which caused Agnostic Maybe [to clarify](http://agnosticmaybe.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/the-masters-degree-misperception-ctd/) and sound a bit less like a jerk. But I don't like the Officers/Enlisted analogy he employs, because nobody likes the officers. The officers are the planning mucky mucks who make the enlisted people's lives terrible. Why the fuck would I want to be that? The Shelf Check [response to that response](http://shelfcheck.blogspot.com/2010/09/response-to-masters-degree_04.html) was also a bit more moderate.

And then I read a [bunch](http://thewikiman.org/blog/?p=925) of [posts](http://libraryattack.com/?p=219) about where [the value](http://npagelibrarian.blogspot.com/2010/09/librarianship-qualification.html) of an [MLIS](http://maedchenimmond.blogspot.com/2010/09/some-thoughts-on-lis-ma.html) degree [is](http://libreaction.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/library-mas-insufficient-preparation-for-the-real-world-of-information-work/).

So yeah, I pretty much feel like I am a damned fine librarian, with or without this degree I'm buying. I know I need the paper to show that I'm the kind of person who goes to library school, which helps winnow out people who can't afford library school, keeping the profession middle-class, which is bullshit. My mom doesn't want to hear me say that I'd be fine with being a library school dropout, but really, I would be. Library school is teaching me that I am a librarian already, regardless of the paper I can tuck in a box somewhere. This also make the whole getting marked on assignments part of school really insignificant, which I like.
