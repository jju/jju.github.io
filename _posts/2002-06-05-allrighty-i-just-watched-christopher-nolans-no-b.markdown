Allrighty, I just watched Christopher Nolan's no budget first feature entitled Following.  Woweewow.  Remember the first time you saw Pi and thought "Fuck.  That's what movies are supposed to be like!  Money's for chumps!"  Same kind of thing with this.  Yes, Memento's more refined and its chronological fuckaround is more integral to the plot (not plot, theme! Proof I'm not an English grad; despite the novels in my pockets I don't know shit about talking stories) rather than gimmicky, and it doesn't have Mister Pacino being amazing (Sean and I were discussing how Al Pacino should never have to have a character name; characters he plays should be named after him.  It worked for Tony Danza), but tres cool.  It's great how there's a real sense of the director's voice in all three of these puppies.  They all feel like they were done by the same guy.  I think Memento is a better movie (much like Requiem for a Dream is a better movie than Pi), but for a first feature, fucking-A.  I mean, early Coen brothers' stuff was good, but I think they only started getting really cool with Barton Fink.  Miller's Crossing, mieh; Raising Arizona I guess wasn't bad, but nothing compared with the more recent stuff.  I probably screwed up the order of those Coen films eh?  I bet Barton Fink was before both of the others I just mentioned blowing my point all to shit.  As an aside, I want to see the Coen brothers do one of these comic book adaptation movies.  I mean, Sam Raimi did Spider-man, Ang Lee's doing The (Incredible?) Hulk, Darren Aronofsky's supposedly (according to a half heard Internet rumour [the kind which we all hope will be legally binding someday]) doing Batman: Year One, what could we lobby the Coens to do?  Fuck, they'd have to do Watchmen, or maybe Preacher.  Someone suggest a good comic book adaptation for the Coens to do.
  

  
In other news, my mom returned from her Alaskan cruise that she took with my grandma and had a good time.  Sean will have to content himself with a couple of pictures of the helicopter because I didn't get her to ask the pilot for the reams of technical information that Sean wanted.  I did a test pack of my backpack for the trip on Saturday, which was exciting.  Now I know which things I need smaller lighter versions of and stuff like that.  Just knowing that I'm going to live six months of my life on four shirts made me happy.
  

  
I read a Tim Powers book this weekend, Expiration Date.  Thomas Edison's ghost was a major character.  Not quite as good as Last Call, which I heartily recommend.  Last Call is a Las Vegas story, about this poker game played with tarot cards that's held on a houseboat to assume souls in bids to usurp Bugsy Siegel as the True King of Las Vegas.  Amazingly cool book.  Expiration Date, not so much.  Now I'm reading On the Road, 'cause Stevie G is/was reading it.  I like keeping up with what my friends read.  Big Loud is the one who inspired me to read my first Kundera book, and a few weeks ago I read The Brothers K because of Dave.  Got to keep the reading material mixed up; variety makes your life's tongue bleed.
