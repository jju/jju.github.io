I forgot to mention the magazine I found lying in the drama section of the library yesterday.  It was some little magazine for moms and it was lying there on a shelf next to the Beckett plays.  I love it when I find things like that, some incongruous thing that's been left lying in a section belying the vast and diverse interests people have.  
  
That's the one good thing about being a page.  I have an actual reason to be in sections my interests wouldn't lead me to browse in.  I can sit in the romance section gawking at the shit people will read with a perfectly legitimate reason.  [It's just like watching gay porn](http://achewood.com/index.php?date=03282007).    
  
The other thing I love is the 000 section, which is where computers and paranormal phenomena and other things that nobody had thought of when the DDS was being created.  I don't need to be a page to love this though, and hope that I will be getting a non-page position in the next month or two.  
  
One final thing I love is being asked by an editor to make something better.  I got an email on one of my Machine of Death stories and he was all, "It's great, vivid, unique, all that, but then at the end it just goes vague.  Would you be able to do a climactic scene that's, you know, good?"  And I'm working on it.  My problem with endings is that I'm always so tempted to make them overly clever or cliched that I shy away from having anything at all happen.  A kick in the ass about it is a good thing.  He didn't promise it would be accepted for the anthology with a new, good, ending, but the mere fact that it pissed him off that the ending was so crappy is sort of like a good sign.
