I don't have the net hooked up at my apartment yet, so I'm paying too much to keep you informed right now.  Being a spoiled only child rocks on toast.  My apartment is so furnished with stuff that my mom went on a buying spree to get me it's pretty sweet.  So yeah.  Mom left today and I've got a few days till classes start and I become busy beyond my past year of being a lazy ass to comprehend.   And I won't be a pretentious fuck, asshole.
