My usual lunch when I decide to eat is baozi.  Baozi are steamed buns with some sort of filling, usually ground pork but sometimes you get unlucky and it's sour roots.
  

  
I have a usual baozi place where the woman knows which kind I like so I just have to smile and hand her money.  The thing is that there's now a brand new baozi place that opened up across the street.  It's got shiny metal steamers instead of wooden ones and a freshly painted interior instead of dinginess.  The other main difference is that the baozi there are really small.
  

  
I'm used to baozi that are about the size of a racquetball (those are the blue ones right?).  I'd buy three of them for 1 RMB.  They were about three bites apiece.  This new place has little (a bit bigger than a golf ball) one bite baozi but they sell them by weight.  That means you get a lot more baoziness for your kuai.  Well, it probably also ups the bread:filling ratio making the materials less expensive, but making so many more would seem to cost more in terms of labour.
  

  
My baozi place is now doing the little baozi too, selling them by weight.  I don't have a big problem with this except for one thing.  Three larger baozi was the perfect amount for my lunch.  Now 1 RMB buys me too many baozi and I don't want to finish them.  
  

  
My Mennonite cheapness is saying "More value!  That's great!" but my Wal-Mart hating socially responsible side (as an aside, what the fuck was up with Steve Maich's 8 pages of pro Wal-Mart propaganda in the July 25th Maclean's?) is saying "Just because you get more doesn't mean it's better."  
  

  
Anyway, I'm interested in how the baozi situation will develop.
