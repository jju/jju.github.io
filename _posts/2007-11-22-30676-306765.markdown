At work I actually talked with a coworker for more than a brief exchange of "Hey." It's happened before, so yeah, whatever not that big a deal but here's something you may not know about me (knowing you all know this far too well): I don't speak well to others. Part of it is an inability to make small talk without it feeling forced/faked.

I've often looked at the [xkcd store](http://xkcd.com/store) and seen [this shirt](http://xkcd.com/store/just_shy_shirt_thumb.png). I think of buying it but then my [inner Roast Beef](http://achewood.com/index.php?date=08042003) takes over and I realize I can't advertise my shyness. [It would all end in tears](http://achewood.com/index.php?date=02182004).

Anyway, coworker and I discussed zen mind tricks in aid of shelving and I informed her of the craziness of Dewey's Gay Urban Planning section of the library. And then I ran off and hid, slowly recuperating from the mental anguish.
