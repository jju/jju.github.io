Everything old is new again.  So you may have noticed that my blog has changed addresses.  We're now paying for space but there's no ads!  Yippie ki yay Mister Falcon.
  

  
Don't really look at DJS5.com yet.  It needs some work and some ideas from the guys to get it up to snuff.
  

  
In the meantime it is a week from tomorrow that I leave the cozy confines of Peg City.  And say hi to Hassie's relatives in Pennsylvania.  Shannon's Irish pub should be hopping with live karaoke and a bunch of my gaming friends who are all coming by.  Journalism friends who happen to be in Winnipeg in two days are also welcome.
