Guess who was wished a happy (belated) birthday by John McCrea?  This guy! Mad thanks to Dave who saw Cake play in Austin (at SXSW) and then met him (because of his lovely and talented wife who, you know, goes up to people and talks to them).  
  

  
House of Doc will be playing at Winnipeg Folk Fest this year and everyone who isn't in China (or being oriented in Pennsylvannia) has to go see them, 'cause they're being all professional and stuff.
