It's been a slow day today.  I went to work, stopped at Campaign afterwards and have been watching baseball since.  If you've been paying attention you know I was going tohave an interview with a magazine this weekend.  That got moved to oh hell, three weeks from now.  Which actually works out well because it allows me more time to get a few more irons all firing.  
  
Tomorrow should be fun though.  There's a Vajournal party.  Sadly Zelda won't be showing up, being all busy and such.  Le sigh.  Not to be a prick but there's something about being at a party with the most beautiful girl in the room.  And then being able to steal away for mad smooches?  Nice E Nice.  I suppose it's too warm for coat rooms anyway.  Selah.
