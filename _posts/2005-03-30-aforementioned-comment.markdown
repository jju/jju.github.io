My cousin posted some stuff on his blog about [natural selection](http://tblog.ath.cx/troy/?comments=on&entry=20050326174755&cat=Frontpage&sid=) on Saturday.  I usually can't access his site and still couldn't get to the comments for this one (and thus haven't read them) so I'm commenting here.  From here on it's addressed to Troy, so I'm not calling **you** names.
  

  


<blockquote>Dumb people would die. Weak people would die. Stubborn people would die. The genetic algo built into ourselves would build towards a smarter, stronger, more creative future complete with success and failure. Smart people would put seatbelts in their cars because it is a smart thing to do, and no laws would be required to enforce it.</blockquote>


  

  
There's a thing called money that you might possibly have heard of.  Economic disparities make more of a difference in how smart or dumb or strong or weak a person is than your genetic algorithm.  It doesn't matter how smart a person is and how much a person knows they should use a seatbelt if the only car they can afford is a shitbucket on wheels.
  

  
Of course this is only the beginning.
  

  


<blockquote>When they took a risk, they were infected [with AIDS], and they should have to live with the consequences of Natural Selection in action. If they can find a way to cure themselves, or deal with the disease whilst still being productive to themselves, then so be it.</blockquote>


  

  
Have you heard of Africa you ignorant twat?  [Kids die every 15 minutes](http://alternet.org/envirohealth/21618/) of AIDS in Zimbabwe.  And the risk they took was being born.  Your going on about risk management and genetics naturally leading to a stronger better future is bullshit.  Economics mean these kids die and other people live.  Genetic algorithms don't take care of that.  As an AIDS baby your family (if you have one) might love you all to pieces but if they can't afford the drugs that'll save your life you're fucked.  That's the natural selection you're talking about.
  

  
And if you seriously consider 40 million people dying a good thing for the future of the species I encourage you to meet a person someday and get to know him or her.
