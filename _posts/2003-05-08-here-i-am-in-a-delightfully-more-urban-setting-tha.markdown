Here I am in a delightfully more urban setting than I've lived in since Cairo.  It's kind of funny because my place now is smaller than that excellent first hotel room Ren and I shared in Cairo, though this also has a surprisingly spacious bathroom and a kitchen (and a loft! tee hee hee! I've never lived in a place that had a second story before and this one even uses a ladder!).  Don't get me wrong, fakeLondon is no Cairo.  It's quiet at night and there aren't many people wandering the street at all hours.  I can see blue sky, but strange enough, few stars at night.  I've got a decent little game/comic shop a block away and a couple more comic shops just up a road.  Book stores and Indian restaurants, and fakeLondon's cinema city 8 equivalent ($4 instead of $2.50, but not too bad) all surround me.  It's an easier place to find interesting things going on and drug deals going down than Tuxedo was (or maybe that was just me).
  

  
Tomorrow is the big day wherein I get my first hint if people here get jokes, or if I'm going to spend my year in misery apart from those times when cool people visit me.  Speaking of which Sean and Ren (and Stevie G?), you'll need to bring sleeping bags when you come out, but I think I've got the mattress situation handled as long as it is just you two (three?).  If Chris comes along too, someone's sleeping in the bathtub.  
  

  
My internet (and *sigh* basic cable, I folded and got television so I can watch the end of the playoffs and Jays games - oh, and cbcnewsworld because I'm a responsible and serious journalism student) got hooked up today, explaining this extended post.
