Most of my spam and viruses these days is a direct result of having given my email address to students.  I guess the Chinese free email providers aren't as up to date on their filters.  And the address books get sold off to all sorts of bidders.
  

  
So next time I'll set up a special email for receiving all that crap (plus the occasional incoherent student questions).
