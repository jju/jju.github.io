Well now I've done it.  I sort of led a workshop on Tuesday about writing home and extolled the wonders of blogging in a way that would make anyone from Benedetti's class eyes roll.  So I've got to practice what I preach or some other horrible cliche.  
  
Really though, it's been a bunch of classes and horribly painful tutorial sessions.  I've always hated meeting individually with teachers, like making appointments and suchlike formal arrangements.  And in this kind of setting where there are things I should be pushing myself to learn, I do even worse.  I like spinning off into tangents (as the people in my workshop can attest to) but I know I should be learning.  
  
It's weird how as I learn more Chinese I don't mind slacking off more.  Holly seems to want to keep advancing but I can't keep up with her.  The thing that's different about this compared with J-Skool where other people were also obviously better than me at all sorts of things was that we could each kind of find our own niches to be good at.  We're only learning one subject here which is very bad for that remnant of a competitive edge I've still got.  
  
Yesterday James and Michelle and I were given flyers for a punk show this Friday.  So a bunch of us are going to see if Chinese punk shows are closer to Western punk shows or Chinese daily life in terms of spitting.  
  
In the workshop I led one thing that really made me uncomfortable was how much of a propagndist model we were adopting.  There was a lot of pressure to not talk about the bad stuff and only the good.  Hell, that was one of my main points; since we're a lot of people's sole view of China maybe we shouldn't spend our entire time and all our verbiage complaining.    
  
But I also want to be accurate.  Let me cite my oft-used Spider Jerusalem creed: "I'm a journalist.  It's my job to tell you where I am today and what I think it looks like."  If it looks like a shitty god forsaken hole you'd catch syphillis from walking by, I want to tell you that and not just ignore it because it doesn't paint the country in a nice light.    
  
I really disagreed with the people in our group who talk about getting the subjects of your stories to vet them before you present them in a public setting.  I won't do that.  I trust in my ability to tell stories that are important or interesting enough to tell, and to tell them with sensitivity (or blanket insensitivity/irreverence).  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'll correct it, according to all those citizen journalism non-creeds.  
  
Whatever.  Enough soap-boxing.
