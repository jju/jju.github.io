I hadn't mentioned the availability of sunlight recently in my many lamentations about the cold. Primarily because all this light is doing precious little to keep it from being -13 when I'm walking to work. But I do notice it. And appreciate it.

Special Services today was relatively non-exciting. Except there's a guy who wants the staff at our desk to redeem his Coke points for him because he says he can't on the library computers. He's kicked it up to the supervisory level and everything. He's so angry the man is getting in the way of him and his thousand Coke points.

A big part of my job there is helping Print Handicapped patrons get their audiobooks. They're people who are registered with the CNIB as visually impaired but who still like to read. We keep track of the audiobooks (some of them designed for special players) they've borrowed so we don't send them stuff they read recently when they say "I'd like ten books please." Today a lady called with her husband dictating a list of books she wanted from the background. She was very nice. I hope she liked the extras I picked for her.
