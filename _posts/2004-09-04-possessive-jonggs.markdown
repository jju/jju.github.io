Today was really good and really anti everything I like my Saturdays to be.
  

  
I would have planned to just lie about and read and do some studying.  But earlier in the week Paula told me that her class was going to hike up the mountain, and would I like to come along?  Of course I would.  
  

  
So I was up at 7am to meet up with them at our school's front gate in the rain.  Now, I don't use umbrellas.  I wear a rainjacket normally.  I realize that I will have to buy one because no one believes me that my jacket is fine and I don't need one.  So they lend me theirs and it all gets messed up.
  

  
We took the bus to the bottom of the mountain and then climbed stairs for maybe twenty minutes.  Nothing at all.  When we got to the top there was a little building that had card tables and a KTV machine.  So we started playing cards and Mah Jongg.  Which I am now officially a "bad player of" as opposed to a "person who doesn't have a clue how to play it without a computer (which isn't even really the same game)."   
  

  
This went on for hours.  We had lunch, which reminded me of why I was a vegetarian since all the meat in it had been lying around (on paper) the whole morning with dogs around.  Well behaved dogs, but still.
  

  
We played a bit of pool and mucked about in the playground, took some pictures, and talked.  So draining.
  

  
Around 5pm we walked down the mountain, took the bus back to the school's neighbourhood and had a wicked good dinner.
