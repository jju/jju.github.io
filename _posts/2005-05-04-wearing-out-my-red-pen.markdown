I'm sure using my week off to its fullest potential.  Today I marked American culture midterms.  
  

  
They average somewhere in the low 70s, with one girl getting 98.  I was happy for her because she seems worried to death all the time.  Whenever I'm teaching she seems to be getting angry that I'm not cracking open her skull and loading everything I know about America into it by the steaming shovelful.  So hers is a good barometer of whether my exam is stupid difficult or not.  If she has trouble then I'm not asking the questions I thought I was.  But she breezed through it, so it's all good.
  

  
Some of my students still think black people aren't allowed to vote.  We'll work on fixing that one next class.
