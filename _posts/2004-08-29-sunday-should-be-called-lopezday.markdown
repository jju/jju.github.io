Yesterday was really quite good.  90% of its goodness came from not teaching, but through conversations with a bunch of my students I think I'm getting on track.  See, it's weird, I'm teaching 4 classes of seniors.  This is their fourth year of being trained as teachers, while I've never done this before.  They're patient and I know a bit more what they want out of the classes now, which will let me do a bit more autopiloting.

In the afternoon I took the bus downtown with Alex, who isn't my student and "despises" all the English department students for being so arrogant.  He's in the tourism department.  He showed me around a bit.  We also went down to the river.  I like the Yangtze (or Chang Jiang).  In the morning I finished a book called [The River at the Centre of the World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312423373/qid=1093752802/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-1599600-6264120), which was all about this river.  It's muddy here, and wide, and I can't tell where the water will eventually rise to when the dam goes fully online.

A few students came over last night and we talked about the Olympics and I showed them pictures from (Reyn's and) my trip.  So many of these students would like to travel, I feel kind of bad telling them about all the places I've been.  All that white middle-class guilt.  But then I put on my iPod and forget all about it!
