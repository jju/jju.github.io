A week without the internet did not kill me. Of course that was a week without the internet conveniently at home. I could still get my email and things from work; I just had to be more intentional about it. Which probably isn't a super bad thing. Here's what you missed: I read some books, watched some movies, [painted some miniatures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/3837175488/), and worked a bit.

Last week at the library a deaf lady tried to kill herself by jumping over the railing on the third floor. Library staff and security wrestled her down and had to prevent her from trying to strangle herself before the cops arrived. We also found some unattended shoes in the men's washroom. (Separate incidents.) Oh, and a guy got escorted out of the library for yelling "How come every time I come to this fuckin' library the fuckin' computer won't let me watch fuckin' [Budgie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54H3EUAzpVg)?!" when the computer froze up on him.
