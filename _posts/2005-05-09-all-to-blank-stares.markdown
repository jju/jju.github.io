It was the ever wonderful Music lecture in American Culture today!  I brought in my iPod and played examples from a bunch of important genres.  We started with Benny Goodman, hit Elvis and Johnny Cash, talked about protest songs with Bob Dylan, Kool & the Gang got funky, Neil Young rocked the free world, and brought it into the hiphop age with Jurassic 5 (yeah there could have been way better choices, but J5 is good and old school enough for me plus I could use Verbal Gunfight to draw connections with the earlier played country music) and DJ Dangermouse. As I handed back exams I followed the country/hip hop fusion idea up with Wyclef doing Delia's Gone.
  

  
I've never thought about how buying things from WalMart/Target/Whatever will [help China attack the United States someday](http://www.nationalreview.com/gurdon/gurdon200505060809.asp).  Doesn't that seem paranoid?  I mean, I don't support buying things from sweatshop producers, but it's more of a concern with the workers than with funding the Chinese military.
