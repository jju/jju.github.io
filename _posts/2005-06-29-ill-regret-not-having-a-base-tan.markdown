By this time tomorrow I'll be in full on hobo mode.  Instead of the 80% hobo mode I'm in now.  I hope the students don't mind me spilling vittles on their exams.  Then it'll be months of enjoying the out of doors [like I do every day](http://penny-arcade.com/view.php?date=2005-06-27&res=l).
  

  
I don't know how it's been happening but in the last two days I've gotten like three cuts on my fingers.  On the printed parts.  I hadn't noticed grabbing any razor blades with casual disregard recently.  They're just paper cut style things but still.  They go over the insides of my knuckles and aren't too pleasant when I get sweaty.  Which happens quite a bit when it's 35 degrees every day.
