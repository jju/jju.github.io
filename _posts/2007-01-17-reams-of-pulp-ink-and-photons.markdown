I woke up early this morning with my pen in my hand scribbling down my dream.  No, not scribbling the dream itself down, more like scribbling down the narration of the dream.  I know this because after I went back to sleep and woke up again it still made sense.  And I wrote a fragment that might someday be a good scene.  All before getting out from under the covers.  That's what I call a good start to a day.    
  
I finished another page of PROJECT RIVER down without my phone crapping out on me, two pages of script for a project I'm going to try and get Alison to do the art for when she finishes up her schoolwork, plus the cleanup another page of NEW GIB script.  
  
I was so productive I felt fine taking out a couple of hours to finish watching the first season of Carnivale.  Wow.  Great fucking show.  Although I sort of wish that I knew how many seasons they were planning on.  Is there an endpoint they're trying to reach?  I realize it would be a trivial amount of Googling to figure that out.  Let me cherish my ignorance.  Someday we won't know what to do with not knowing something.
