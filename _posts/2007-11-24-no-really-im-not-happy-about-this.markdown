I've been involved in a few back and forths on Facebook about the Grey Cup which happens on Sunday. I just have to say I hate that it's the Bombers and the Riders in this game. It means I care who wins. I love sports so much more when I don't give a flying fuck who wins. But I really want the Bombers to win. And it makes me so angry that I want it so much. Bah. I want bemused detachment. I don't want to feel bad on Sunday, nor do I want to think a victory means anything important. It's all so dumb. And my guts won't believe my brain on this. Not one bit.
