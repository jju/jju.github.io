I read Holly Black's [The Good Neighbors](rs-Book-One-Kin/dp/0439855624/) at work this week. It's about a teenaged girl whose mom has disappeared because she's a faerie and her dad is being charged with murder. It was all right, and looked very nice, but it was 144 pages of set-up. Like reading the first chapter of a book. Nothing happened. Sure, stuff happened, but nothing interesting. The main character, Rue, was trying to be so blase it just made the whole thing glide by without any real connection. Solidly meh.
