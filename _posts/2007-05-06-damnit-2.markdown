In all the hubbub and rain of yesterday I forgot it was Free Comic Book Day.  No free comics for me.  But I got some good information about printing from Sarah, who had experience in such matters in producing her zine, 1234V.  I will be using that information in production of my own comic book using such luminary artistic talents as my friends.  
  
It was kind of weird how I was the only one who made the transition from the Hassie's leaving till August thing at the Camby to the Cinco de Mayo extravaganza at Reyn's.  Maybe I should have been more forceful in my, "You should come to Reyn's right now!"  I wasn't very forceful at all.  The opposite of force was what I used.  It was ineffective.  
  
Also, don't ever see Ghost Rider.
