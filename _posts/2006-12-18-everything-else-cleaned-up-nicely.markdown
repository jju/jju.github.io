Here's something I find funny:  the lasting damage done by Friday's party has been confined to my pectoral (or whatever the chest muscles that are connected to your shoulders are called) muscles.  Who knew that Steveo could do pushups?  Who knew that I couldn't?  (I did know one of those things before straining myself.  I think it was worth it to learn the other.)  
  
And just so it's clear, I won't be repeating my performance on Tuesday.  I will leave the drunken yelling to the birthday boy.
