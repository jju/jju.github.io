Well it seems tonight is an evening for wasted relationships.  
  
The only foreigner I'm friends with in town is leaving tomorrow, so he invited me to a dinner for his girlfriend and her friends.  Rob's a cool guy and I like hanging out with him.  But I never once called him in the months I knew him.  Even when I was sitting here complaining to you readers about having no one to talk to.  Which sucks because we could have been really good friends instead of being just potentially good friends.  
  
For the record I blame my phone habits.  As anyone who knows me knows, I don't phone people.  I mean, I'll phone my really close friends to say "What's up tonight?  Okay cool"  but that's it.  I don't phone people to chat.  It takes a tonne of effort to work me up into dialing.  I just hate interrupting whatever people are doing.  It's probably some sort of pathology.  
  
Yes, I talked on the phone with Joy.  That was one of many things she trained me in (along with shaving and not being loud about hating _Friends_).  But I've discarded all three of those habits in the past year.  
  
The other wasted relationship news was that [Catherine Bryan got married](http://blogmetodeath.blogspot.com/2005/06/jewish-weddings-are-awesome-catherine.html).  When we were in grade 9 I was her boyfriend, but I was a jerk and spent most of the immediate years after that being weirded out in her presence.  Some of my other friends are friends with her now, but I can't remember the last time I saw her.  Which sucks because we should have remained friends (but we didn't through immature Justinness).  Anyway.  Congratulations to her.
