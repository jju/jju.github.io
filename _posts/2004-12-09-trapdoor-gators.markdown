I went out with some of the foreigners last night and got into an extended cliched conversation about whether it was better to have big deadly animals (bears) or small deadly animals (spiders) in your country with the Aussie.  I still think that we don't have enough contact with our big clawed animals to try pretending we're tough about it.  I can't remember the last time I found a bear that may or may not have been poisonous in my bed.
  

  
But we do have [our own pests](http://www.somethingpositive.net/sp12072004.shtml), so yeah.
  

  
There are three Canadians here now and we're all prairie people.  Two Saskies and me.  We were trying to determine if Spitz was a prairie thing or a Canadian thing.  We also talked about the Labour Day Classic as the point of road trips.  We kept it very civil.
  

  
I wonder where all the girls throwing themselves at me are.  There was only the one creepy speedfreak early on.  One of the Canadians was talking about how you have to watch out for the 26ish year old women because they're more likely to try and get you involved in paternity suits.  For him it's all about the 19-year-olds.
  

  
And I found out that my riot experience was nothing at all exciting.  Two of the foreigners were actually there and were arrested.  So I'm going to interview them for an article.  That's the kind of thing I'll be able to pitch to magazines instead of just being based on my second-hand word on the street stuff.
