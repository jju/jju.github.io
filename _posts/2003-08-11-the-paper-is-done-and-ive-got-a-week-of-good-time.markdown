The paper is done and I've got a week of good times ahead of me before going back to Peg City for three weeks of relaxing times and then back here for 12 weeks of hard times and then back there for two days of fun times and then back here for two weeks of exasperating times and then the holidays.  So I started working on my Christmas list today.
