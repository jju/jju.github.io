I'm slowly moving upstairs.  It's surprising how much I've been able to haul up all those stairs myself.  So far, I've brought up all my little bookshelves, the Lego chest, the futon (sans frame), and my big nice not-completely-pressboard bookshelves.  All that's left is my desk, futon frame and the miniatures wardrobey thing.  It's amazing how much earlier you wake up when the sun comes into your room.
