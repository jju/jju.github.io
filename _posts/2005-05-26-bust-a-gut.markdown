I was just reading my friend [Jackie's blog](http://jackiedirks.blogspot.com/2005_05_01_jackiedirks_archive.html#111682569129814863):


<blockquote>"So, I scheduled 2 and a half hours to learn colon cancer. Like, LEARN it- inside out- pathology, genetics, screening, clinical signs, treatment, everything. And I just finished, triumphantly, at like, 12:30am. And I was really psyched- Booyah! Take that colon cancer- I KNOW YOU!And then I started thinking about the lady I met in the hospital who actually HAD colon cancer and about how she was going to die and that it was terrible and about maybe how I shouldn't feel so triumphant about colon cancer."</blockquote>


Maybe I shouldn't laugh, but I did.  A lot.

Seriously though, go read about being a [med school student](http://jackiedirks.blogspot.com/).  Much more interesting than reading about someone making up exams.
