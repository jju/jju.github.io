Okay, all the exams are writ and now for the anti-climax to set in.
  

  

  

  

  
Oh yeah, there it is.  Nothing like things not changing, eh?  Nothing like finishing a big chunk of your life (4/22=0.18 equals 18% of my life equals 60% of a lot) and having things be almost exactly (but not quite) the same as they were before.  You're still at a party in your friend's cousin's basement but now some of the people that you didn't know four years before, you do a bit.  Accursed gradualness!  Why do things not always happen in big outrageous outbursts so that you can look at your life and say "There!  Right there is when my life changed forever!"  Okay, that was poorly thought through, 'cause I have had one of those experiences this year, and kind of the whole point of the Rev and I going away is to instigate that kind of a thing.  Maybe I'm just worried that what with all these gradual changes when the big things come I'm going to be completely knocked on my ass by them and will wake up twenty years later and go "Dude, what happened there?"  But I watched American Beauty this week and maybe that's where that fear is coming from.  I'm also reading Samuel R. Delany's book Dhalgren, and while I'm really liking it for its formlessness and marginality, it's bothering some vague thing in me.
  

  
I have the plane tickets for our trip.  Ren forgot to take his with him yesterday so I've got both of them.  Now we are going.  I have given units of exchange with an agreed upon value to entities that have provided me with the means to travel to the other side of the planet.  My ticket is in my hand right now, and I am almost as happy as I have ever been.
