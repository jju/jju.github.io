I laugh at how I only found out today (Saturday) what I'm going to be teaching this semester that begins on Monday.  I laugh even more at my great schedule.  I teach Monday Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.  Granted on Tuesday I teach the same class twice in a row, which will be sort of silly, but still.  And no Oral English!  It's American Culture and reading for first-years.  
  
But four day weekends until July!  Sweetness.  
  
Listening to: **Greensleeves** from the album The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings (Disc 4)
