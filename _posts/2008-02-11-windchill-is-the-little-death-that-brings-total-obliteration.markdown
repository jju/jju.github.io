Yesterday on Newsworld the anchor in Toronto made a "-9? Brrr" comment about the forecast. In all seriousness. Fuck you Toronto.

At work today I was sort of a team leader for the Shelf Hauling squadron. Jeff explained what he wanted done on Thursday and there were four pages to do all this crap. I hate leading. I mean, I hate the actual process of me saying "Here's what you need to do" even though I know what the person needs to do. If I had my way I'd just pick a task from a list and do it leaving the rest of the people to figure out their own thing. But I was sort of nominally in charge so I thought some direction was needed. Bah I say.

I think I'm going to finish reading Samuel R. Delany's The Fall of the Towers tonight. It's a novel in three volumes that's been kind of odd. The first part didn't grab me much at all, but then the second part I just tore through because I felt like I finally got what he was talking about. The third part is going back to the more "Green of cicadas. Lightning burst. The city's sand smooths to the horizon." style of writing which I am less than completely enamoured with.
