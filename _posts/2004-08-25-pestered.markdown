I ate dinner at Margie's last night because three of her students were over cooking a meal.  The students don't have any real cooking facilities in their dorms so in order to cook they have to find somewhere to do it.  Anyway, it was like eating dinner at my grandma's.  I ate.  And they said, "Don't you want more?"  So I had some more.  And they said, "You should have more!" So I had more.  And then when I was stuffed to the gills they complained about how I ate so little.  "My brother eats four times as much as that every day!"  "Don't you want to get stronger?"  Sigh.
  

  
I feel bad because my students have to pay for the photocopying of any articles I want to make for them.  Like really, it's not that big a deal for me to do it.  I'm also not supposed to go out and buy batteries for my DVD player and TV remote controls.  Or printer cartridges.  Instead I'm supposed to let the Foreign Affairs Office know so they can get someone to go and buy them for me.  Yeesh.
