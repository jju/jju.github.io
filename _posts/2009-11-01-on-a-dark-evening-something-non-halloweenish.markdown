From [Look to Windward](http://www.librarything.com/work/122) by Iain M. Banks:

<blockquote>Some travel forever in hope and are serially disappointed. Others, slightly less self-deceiving, come to accept that the process of travelling itself offers, if not fulfillment, then relief from the feeling that they should be fulfilled.</blockquote>

And Banks is British, so I'm not even cheating by adding that extra "l" in travelling.
