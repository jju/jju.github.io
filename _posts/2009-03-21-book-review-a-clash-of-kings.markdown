Last week I read [A Clash of Kings](http://www.amazon.ca/Clash-Kings-Book-Song-Fire/dp/0553579908/) by George R.R. Martin, the sequel to [A Game of Thrones](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2009/03/10/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/). It felt like not nearly as much stuff happened in it, though if I sit and count things I suppose the events would probably even out. It felt like there was much less urgency in this book. Even though I knew how _A Game of Thrones_ ended since that was a re-read, I felt a real hand grabbing my shoulder making sure I paid attention to what was about to happen to all of these characters. In _A Clash of Kings_ there wasn't that same feeling. It was more like catching up with the people you'd been introduced to previously. Things weren't nearly as drastically different at the end from the beginning as they were in _A Game of Thrones_. Not that I didn't like it, I just wasn't as in awe of it as I was of the relentlessness of the first book. That is all.
