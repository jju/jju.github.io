I just finished [The Diamond Age](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380966/qid=1109133872/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-7085229-0639062) by Neal Stephenson.  I've had the chance to just read instead of planning classes, because none of the offices at the school are open to actually give me a schedule.  So we'll see.  
  
The Diamond Age had one really good point of intersection with the last book I read, John Fowles' [The Magus](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0440351626/qid=1109133805/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-7085229-0639062?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), and that was the idea of theatre without an audience.  In The Diamond Age it's only a small part about a group of ractors (short for interactors) called Dramatis Personae who do performances using virtual reality that goes on in crisscrossing dynamic stories.  It really is based on the RPG interactivity kind of model which you'd know about if you're Finnish.  
  
The Magus deals with it in decidedly low-tech and more psychological ways (and it's pretty much what the book is about instead of one small part).  I saw way too much of my own audience creation tendencies in the character in The Magus, which probably is only exacerbated by blogging about them.  Selah.  
  
Anyway, if you're looking for books to read neither of these would be poor choices.  Now I have to decide if I read my new Murakami book, [Kafka on the Shore](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400043662/qid=1109134426/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-7085229-0639062), or keep on prolonging the anticipation.  It's been a few weeks of building so I'll probably start it up.  Just be warned that if it's as sad as Sputnik Sweetheart was you're going to be reading very mopy posts for a while.  
  
I wish I could get Amazon Prime shipping to Wanzhou.
