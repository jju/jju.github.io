So, I'm now on an organized sports team.  How do these things happen?  I'm playing Ultimate this summer, on our journalism program's team.  We're called Hack.  'Cause it's sort of clever.  And all XFL what with being a verb and such.  I wanted to be the Dumples, but got shouted down at the meeting.  I'm lying.  There was no meeting.  Our captain is a non benevolent despot who doesn't believe in those kinds of things.
  

  
I'm reading books about China right now.  It's the next place I want to go, and I want to get some background in this pretty little head of mine.  I love the idea I heard from some pundit on CBC which said that SARS was going to be China's Chernobyl, causing massive glasnost in its wake (to simplify grossly).  So learning about and going to China is a very good idea for someone interested in how the world is.  Maybe.  Or I might have just realized that the only thing I really like about Canada is the easy access to movies and that I want to be somewhere else.  Maybe.  Whatever.
