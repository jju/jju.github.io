I went into TO last night because our program was given 5 free tickets to an awards dinner.  The thing itself was pretty boring, but it had an open bar before dinner, and I got to talk to Knowlton Nash after.  I also got my picture taken for being "distinctive looking."

Now I have a paper to research and write for Friday.  Merrily off I go!
