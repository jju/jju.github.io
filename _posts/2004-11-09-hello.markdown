I'm back from Nanchong.  The bus ride today wasn't bad, but it stayed off the expressway for a lot more than I thought it would.  Which was nice cause even with stopping to change a tire it only took 6 1/2 hours and we got to wind through the mountains past little towns and farms.  
  
I'll write about Nanchong later so in the meantime read [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29470-2004Nov5.html) about arrogant liberal elites.
