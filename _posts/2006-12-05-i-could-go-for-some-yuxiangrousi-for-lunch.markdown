Things I do miss about China: 1) cheap delicious meals that swim in oil  2) [these types of exchanges](http://www.danwei.org/media_regulation/glimpses_inside_the_chinese_me.php): (In this case they're talking about Proxzee, a method for getting around the Great Firewall)

<blockquote>Denial  
  
Zheng: What do you mean, you can visit blocked sites with it? If you can visit them, they aren't blocked!  
  
Me: No, the sites are blocked. You can't access them directly in China. This site enables you to access them indirectly, through their own server.  
  
Zheng: Well, the government must know about this. And since they don't block Proxzee, it means there actually aren't any blocked sites. If you can visit them, they aren't blocked. Maybe the sites you think are blocked are just down from time to time. Maybe you don't have your browser settings right. Don't jump to conclusions.</blockquote>

Read the whole article.  It covers a whole range of responses that you'd be sort of flabbergasted to hear here.  Sort of like someone who'd never heard of PayPal.  I sometimes do miss the constant flabbergastedness.
