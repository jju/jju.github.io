Holly made it to Vancouver all right. It was cut a bit close, but everything worked out in Guangzhou. I'm sure [she'll blog about it](http://hollyrinny.blogspot.com) soon. We're at my old house now while Brenda is off skiing with her family.

Yesterday I tried to get a SIM card but failed so you still can't call me in Vancouver. I'm still on Skype though, and really, isn't that all a person really needs in this day and age? The only thing is that I can't really receive texts. I might get a cheapo pay-as-you-go number for those rare times I need to communicate out of WiFi range and to spoof as my CallerID number for Skype.

Today we moved a bunch of stuff out of storage and into my room in my new apartment. Holly and I both really like my new roommate Emma. We got keys, drove to the storage locker, did a quick selection of important stuff I'd need (like a bed and a pile of computers and books), got lunch, unloaded the van, almost got a parking ticket, carried the stuff up to the fourth-floor apartment (Emma and Holly did that so I could get the van back in time), and then sat and chatted for hours before heading home on the SkyTrain and stopping for pizza.

Now we're just drinking tea.
