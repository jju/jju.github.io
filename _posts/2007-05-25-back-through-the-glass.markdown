So I've been quiet here for a few days.  Just thinking about stuff I suppose.  One of the things I was thinking about was an exchange my mom had with someone last week (which she told me about).  It was about me and one of my female friends.  I have female friends you see.  Ones who (for the most part) are my friends in exactly the same ways as my guy friends are (though they tend to not be as fond of geeky games).  
  
But last week a third party told my mom that she was a fool to think nothing was going on between me and one of these friends (let's call her Zelda though that's not her real name).  Mom protested that Zelda and I were just friends and that the two of us being romantickal would be like her getting romantickal with her (married, female, heterosexual) best friend.    
  
"Pshaw!" came the reply.  "Give them enough alcohol and they'll get together!"  And I suppose that might be true.  We'll see soon I guess.  
  
On a completely unrelated note, I worked in Transcona earlier this week.  Talk about places that make me feel like I'm travelling, Geez.  I had to check a map, and ask for directions and even got on the wrong bus.  In the rain.  Oh those travel centres in the brain fired but good though.
