I'm reading Choke by Chuck Palahniuk (now in paperback Sean) and I must say I'm a fan.  I mean, it's not like they're heavy reading and you zip right through the books, but there's a lot of good stuff in there.  On the Fight Club DVD he talks about how he has gotten approached by people who want to license the Tyler Durden character and do "The Further Adventures"  I like how the interesting provocative things that he says in his work always comes out of the mouths of disturbed characters, who you really shouldn't take seriously, but there's this kernel that makes some kind of sense, and that's what you remember while you're having sex (or you think of freshly sliced cucumbers lying in a refrigerator, you know, whatever).
  

  
Last night I did write a really good post about vanity and cynicism and how it relates to roleplaying games, but something happened when I hit the p&p button and it disappeared.  So you can untie the cord now; we need to dry it off.
