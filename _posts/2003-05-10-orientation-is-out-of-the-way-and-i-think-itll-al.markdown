Orientation is out of the way and I think it'll all be okay.  And when I say all, I mean the tiny portion of my tiny life that is concerned with school and work and success and stuff.  Everything else is still fucked or not according to the whims of a big laughing g or not.  There's a pay attention to me because I'm a big clown kind of guy.  Another is married, and seems younger (but is actually older) than me, but has spent some time in Ireland, Poland, that whole Czechered area.  Also a tallish (not Dave height) guy who spent a year in China and 8 months in Korea (South I'm assuming) and is a little gullible.  There is a girl from Winnipeg and the UofM.  There are also an inordinate amount of Saskies.  One of them is originally from Carman though.  Nobody I actively detest yet.  Faculty all seem decent and sans sticks in orifices so that's good.  There is a bar in the basement of the building most of our classes are in, and the studios and such all seem decent enough.  I've got to pick up my bus pass (included in my tuition) on Monday so tomorrow I'll spend a cycling day.
  

  
Yesterday I had to take a bus as far east as it would go and then walk about the same distance more to pick up a package that the fucking Purolator driver was too much of a goddamned moron to wait 20 seconds to see if I was home before he left so he brought it back to the warehouse then walked that distance back to a bus stop and then my 90 minute transfer had expired so I had to pay again to get home.  And then Vancouver decided to lose.  
  

  
Summary: Yesterday can get fucked with a screwdriver.  Today gets ribbed for its pleasure (which isn't as much as you'd think).
