The Dan Bern concert was really good last night.  He sang Black Tornado and Jerusalem (and a pile of stuff from his new album, but not Feel Like a Man which is my favourite on Breathe) and a song about how he was pissed off about the Virginia Tech shooting.  I guess I wished for more banter, but what there was was all good.  
  
After the show we went and barbecued a pineapple at Reyn's.  Very tasty.  Even without the cinnamon/cayenne that got RMCed into the affair.
