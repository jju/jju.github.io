Yesterday in Section 22 a patron came to the counter mentioning that the men's washroom smelled like gasoline. I headed over to check it out. Inside, I heard a distinctive snort kind of noise and went back to the desk, where Jane called security. Head of security came up to check and they closed off the bathroom. 

It was at this point that Harriet heard something was going on and proceeded to contribute blue tape to help seal off the bathroom. "Oh, but should it be yellow? That's more standard isn't it?" went the squawking of this vital decision making. Security generally tries not to deal with Harriet. Eventually security brought up actual Caution tape and closed off the bathroom while Harriet phoned various people more responsible than her, vaguely worried about a bomb. Security's opinion was that it was a gas-huffer.

Then later she wrote up the incident report, which was nice and funny. She had some problems saving it so I helped. The main problem was that she wouldn't read the error message that popped up so she couldn't know how to rename the file, but whatever. The procedure she was following was incorrectly written. One might think that an information professional would have to be marginally literate in dealing with computers in this millennium, but one would be wrong.

The funny part of the report wasn't the abundance of grammatical errors; it was how skewed the perception of the event was. Jane and I aren't mentioned. "Security reported a scent." She made sure to include the fact that she supplied Security with tape and scissors for closing off the washroom. Security's report might not have mentioned that vital fact. Fair enough, I guess. It's not like I leapt in to correct it.

Also, Smigs might have finally gone too far in harassing people and could be getting a 3 year ban. More news as the story develops.
