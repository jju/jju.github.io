I spent this morning catching up on [le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink).  On Friday I just hit a wall and was not ready to do one.  And then last night I forgot.  
  
I also did such exciting things as buying groceries.  Hopefully the morrow will take a bit more advantage of my university-going friends' Reading Week.
