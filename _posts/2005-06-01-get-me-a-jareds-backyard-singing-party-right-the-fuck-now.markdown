I'm simply never going to answer my phone again.  
  

  
But that won't work.  It'll just mean I'll miss those rare occasions where it's someone I want to talk to (apart from the past week where I've been inundated in the best possible way with calls I enjoyed), and the horrible nasty tedious messages of stupidity will still find their way to me somehow.
  

  
Because I picked up the phone tonight I am going to a primary school(?),  middle school(?), some fucking kind of school in some fucking county with some fucking vice president of the university as his goddamned motherfucking chimpanzee.  "Look!  We've got a white guy!  Here, he'll teach for you!"
  

  
And I will smash my chains of politeness, bare my teeth, and grab the cutest girl I can find on my way up the county's tallest building.  It'll take a long time for them to scramble planes to shoot me down.
  

  
"Oh, but it's easy for you!"  Adi says as I'm telling her this sounds ridiculous (and not in the fun dimension-hopping robots who enjoy pie kind of ridiculous).  "You just have to teach them some oral English."
  

  
I don't know why they don't get the fucking awardwinning teacher to go do this bullshit instead of this shitass retarded moron who doesn't know what the fuck he's doing in his own classes let alone some fucking middle school kids.
  

  
Fucking hell.  If only I had a way to absolutely rip the shit out of my vocal chords by Friday morning.  But that surefire way is thirteen fucking time zones behind me.
