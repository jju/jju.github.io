The more you read about time and what the future could possibly be like, the less interesting the news becomes.  If people were able to live for thousands of years, who would give one iota's worth of a shit about who won provincial volleyball championships, or who got shot when?  
  
I used to think about space travel at relativistic speeds as a huge deterrent to interstellar voyages.  But really, if we could deal with the medical problems, even with prolonged stasis kinds of devices, the whole concept of time passing at different speeds for people at home vs those who are away doesn't seem as scary to me anymore.  Maybe it's just because through the novelistic window you get a bigger picture and can start to deal with groups instead of individuals.
