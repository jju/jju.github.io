Supposedly some friends of mine wonder if I ever do any actual work out here.  Yes I do.  I generally don't blog or write emails about the prep that I do for my classes and things.  If you'd like I could talk about how I fight with Wikipedia and get up at 6:30 every morning just to make sure my students learn something whether they like it or not.  Or I can just talk about the interesting stuff.  
  
That getting up at 6:30 thing.  Joy never believed I wasn't a morning person.  I'm really not.  But if I have to get up I want to get up right away and not fuck around with snooze bars and such.  Getting out of bed quickly is the best way for me to get over wanting to stay in bed, which I do desperately every day.  Especially when the room is chilly like it gets here overnight.  I don't know what would happen if I overslept and was late for (or missed) a class.  That isn't an exciting thing to get in trouble for, and you readers deserve the best I can offer.
