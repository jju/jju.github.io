Ooo sexy new blogger (editing side).
  

  
I want to eke out an existence independent of politics or whatever the fuck is going on in the world.  I realized this last night at a panel on Canada-US relations.  Politics suck.  Even when it's the sort of thing that makes sense to me and I would agree with, really; why take everything so seriously?  Yeah things happen that are bad, but fuckit.  Do what you need to do to get by and be happy.  If you can't, then say fuck you and try anyway.  If the planet is dying and all that or the Americans are going to put weapons in space or whatever, say that sucks if it does for you.  But change the world?  I'm never going to do that.  I just want to escape its notice so I can do my own little pointless things.  I suppose there are people who get off on fixing or fucking the world and good for them, just don't try to fix or fuck me along with it.
