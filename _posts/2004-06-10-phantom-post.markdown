This won't make any difference to anyone but me, but hey, that's what blogging is for.  On our [jskool blog](http://journalism2004.blogspot.com), J.Low posted this on June 9 at 1:58pm.
  

  
_"Don't forget the overworked Quesnel Cariboo roving reporter for her (in the words of Cliff Lonsdale) excellent writing, meticulous research and for being on time -- unlike the rest of us slackers in TV, it's true, we were slackers -- the Syndicon Producer's Award went to Joyanne Pursaga. 
  

  
I thought the PR was especially sweet because I enjoyed getting a PR award in a very anti-PR faculty. Oh sweet justice! As Suzanne told me, I am the leader of the dark-side. Join me, won't you? But good work to everyone, not just those with shiny plaques and trophies.
  

  
It was fun seeing all of you. And don't worry Heidi you're an award winner in your own right. I think the thing I got the biggest kick out of was seeing everyone's middle names printed in the convocation booklet. Kudos to all with two or more middle names! And no I'm not named after Jimmy Stewart."_    
  

  
At some time later in the afternoon he [removed the last two paragraphs](http://journalism2004.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_journalism2004_archive.html#108680459616729820).  The question, of course, is why.
