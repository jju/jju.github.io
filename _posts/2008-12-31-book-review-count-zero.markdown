I didn't realize [Count Zero](http://www.amazon.ca/Count-Zero-William-Gibson/dp/0441013678/) was the source for the famous William Gibson phrase "The street finds its own use for things." It's a cyberpunk novel set in the Sprawl of eastern North America. It has the standard Gibson plot with houngans and badass street-samurai and all this stuff I first learned of in the Shadowrun RPG. Part of the source material though. Bobby Newmark is in here too, and I feel like that name is really famous or something (though I may be thinking of the RZA and Bobby Digital). Add in the fact that I read Count Zero's sequel [Mona Lisa Overdrive](http://www.amazon.ca/Mona-Lisa-Overdrive-William-Gibson/dp/0553281747/) in the last few months and everything about this reading felt half-remembered. Which fit thematically. I do love the electroded way of jacking into the Matrix, and the ICE and all that. Even though it's not how the future's going to be I still love reading these things.
