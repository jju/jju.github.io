I had a video crew in my classroom today and couldn't stop laughing at it.  I suppose it was for their own promotional work or whatever, but I have such a desire to wander down to the Foreign Affairs Office and demand the tape.  
  
I also started tabulating some of my class marks to see if my scheme actually works, and it does!  I thought for a little while that the two test case classes had radically different scores for attendance but then I found the reason and they averaged out exactly the same.  Very pleased I'm not being unfair about this (mathematically speaking).
