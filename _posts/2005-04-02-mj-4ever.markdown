I went up the mountain with one of my freshman classes for a "picnic" today.  We actually ate at a hotel/restaurant kind of thing that was pretty snazzy.  But they set out the tables for mahjongg and played a pile.  I forced them to actually teach me how it worked instead of basically playing for me like the last time I learned.  So I think it'll stick.  They all complained about how lucky/clever I was.  
  
Things that are different about this kind of thing than friends getting together in Canada:   
  
1) It's the whole class, and it's billed as a group bonding kind of thing.  Well this one happened to be one English class and one architecture/engineering class.  Guess which supplied each gender.  
  
2) There's a program.  Two students were the MCs  They played party games and the losers had to give performances.  There were three-legged races and apple eating things and a half assed version of Taboo.  (Yes I had to perform.  I sang The Gambler, like I always do at karaoke.)  
  
3) We left at 8:30 am.  On a Saturday.  
  
Anyway, this was a lot more fun than the one I went to last term.  Partly because I knew what to expect and partly because it was a beautiful day.  We had cotton candy in the park coming back!  I couldn't remember the last time I'd had cotton candy.  Still can't.
