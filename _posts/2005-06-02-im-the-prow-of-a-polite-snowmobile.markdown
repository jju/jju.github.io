I've accepted my fate on the stupid thing I have to do tomorrow.  I'll show up, say I'm from Canada, and ask for questions.  That'll be it.
  

  
Did I mention I am a recording star (again)?  Middle school English listening exams!  This is where all the greats got their start.  Greats in what field exactly I am unsure.
  

  
I also had a delegation of senior students come by to hang out this evening.  They said they wanted to come and cook but I'd already eaten when they called.  That wasn't the real point of them coming though.  They were scoping out what the makeup exam was going to be like for Helen next week.  Amanda, the girl who cheated for her was there and Helen herself showed up a bit later.  
  

  
They were all pressing me for details about what the test would be about, and telling me how hard Helen is working and how she has no time to study.
  

  
I've already decided she's passing the fucking exam, but there's no way I'm going to tell her what's on it beforehand.  Not when she's had two chances at it already.  And especially not since it's the exact same one she got Amanda to write in March.
  

  
I'm finally plowing through the archives to [Scary Go Round](http://www.scarygoround.com) and it is one beautiful [classy](http://www.scarygoround.com/?date=20031208) comic.
