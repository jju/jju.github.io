I was out for a walk and while waiting for the light to change a guy asked me if I was baptized. He had a black beard and one of those round porous noses I always look like they were grown to withstand the cold. 

"What?" I asked, because my ears were full of Leonard Cohen. 

"Baptized. Do you have Jesus in your heart?" He took a drag on his cigarette. I told him I was (since I am) but didn't say I do. He told me he was really happy for me and I should have a good day. I hoped he did too.
