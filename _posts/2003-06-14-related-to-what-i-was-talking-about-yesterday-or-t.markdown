Related to what I was talking about yesterday or two days ago or whenever I put up my last post (yes I realize I just have to move my eyeballs a tiny bit to find out, but I won't), I found a page on [ontological anarchy](http://www.deoxy.org/hakim/ontologicalanarchy.htm).  The essay's best line: "Religions and States boast of their permanence - which, we know, is just jive...; what they mean is death."  It's so good 'cause it's jive.  Couple this with a monkeyduck and sand mandalas and you've got something so beautiful I can't even bear it.
