I did not get the job at the Art, Architecture and Planning library at UBC. Selah. I did get a very nice phone call from the librarian who interviewed me (along with two other staffmembers) saying that I did a fine job in the interview and he was sure my experience would be great for somewhere in the future, but they were going with a candidate who had a lot of experience with local art. Which isn't something I could have made myself be, so yeah. It's the kind of situation where their priorities were just things I couldn't fill. I hear that happens sometimes.

The shitty thing is that was probably the last formal GAA position I could possibly have gotten at UBC. I don't think they do those just for the summer months, and come September I won't be a student any longer. So that means I won't have any academic library experience on my resume when I'm off looking for work. I've been trying to diversify through this degree, not focus, but we'll see how much that helps, or if I'll just be every employer's second choice when the real jobhunting comes around.

When I was coming home from school yesterday (on the bus because I don't feel like biking through slush and snow with my fenderless bike) the second bus I got onto wafted with the aroma of weed. It was incredibly strong for a place where no one was smoking. I sat down and another guy got on and as he walked towards the back he just started grinning. "Now this is a Vancouver bus!" he said to no one in particular. A conversation began between a bunch of the people in the back about the guy who had just gotten off the bus, who had been the source of the smells. It was all very friendly and good-natured, about the blessings of being in Canada. Eventually the guy who'd been grinning and who'd started the talking wound it up with "All right. Enough of that. Everyone can go back to their iPhones now."
