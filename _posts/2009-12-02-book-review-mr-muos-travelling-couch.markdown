[Mr. Muo's Travelling Couch](http://www.amazon.ca/Mr-Muos-Travelling-Couch-Sijie/dp/1400077141/) by Dai Sijie was recommended to me by the only scholar of Sichuan dialect literature I know. It was okay. Originally written in French and about a Chinese emigre psychoanalyst virgin who's trying to find a virgin to sacrifice to the diabolical Judge Di. The whole thing didn't really hang together very well. The chronology in the first part was vague but in a way that felt sloppy, not like something to figure out. Overall the whole thing felt like it had been written in one long binge and then not really edited. Which is too bad. It had some funny bits.
