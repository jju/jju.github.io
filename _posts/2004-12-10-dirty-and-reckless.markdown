I'm reading a Paul Bowles book right now and the back blurb has made me supremely pissed off.  I'm a third of the way through it and the thing from the back of the book hasn't happened yet.  It isn't hugely important but it's skewing the way I read everything.  I started it thinking that there was going to be a conversation that we'd try and untangle everything out of  It shifted to different characters and I can't enjoy them because it's just getting further away from this meeting that is supposed to happen.  This meeting where "one remark proves prophetic" and "what seems at first a merely casual encounter is seen to be one rooted in viciousness and horror."  If it keeps up this freaking prophetic remark'll be the very last thing I read.

I have to send in forms and things about when I'll show up in Hong Kong in February.  I have no idea yet.  It depends on lots of things.  How do people make travel plans so far in advance?
