I've been reading Atlas Shrugged and am getting very angry with it.  I knew that Ayn Rand had her own philosophy in her books and that lots of people didn't like that philosophy but I didn't know what it was.  Basically it's talking about how the only way for anything good to happen is for everyone to be a selfish bastard.  It dresses it up in the much nicer clothes of rugged individualism and makes anyone who does think about other people into a complete fucking idiot.    
  
Reading it I hate all those morons who won't do anything for themselves and are just relying on others to look out for the good of everyone.  Which is the problem.  She makes it so obvious that her philosophy is right, that the countryside is made for exploiting and the only good person is a person working towards a selfish goal that it's attractive and I just hate it.  It constructs all these straw man arguments about people who do want to help other people.  Bah.  
  
And I'm only a third of the way through.
