Due to popular demand (well, demand by [Jackie](http://jackiedirks.blogspot.com/) - she's popular, right?) I posted a picture of my [Lego dragon attacking a Viking fort](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/342697100/) (not a real Viking fort - one made of Lego).  Beware, as that picture may be a bit scary for the young/feeble among you (there's a terrifying dragon in it!).  Also check out [my Flickr pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j) if you are interested in seeing some snazzy Necromunda scenery in action.  
  
I performed another one of those things JSkool gave me the skills for today: recording voice-over for a short faux-documentary.  Not like I was reading it, just doing the actual technical work of making sure Alison's brother didn't talk over the top of the mic.  It was just like recording Oral English exams for Miss Hu's brother, except that the sentences were ridiculously long.  I'm completely including this as a "sound technician" credit on my resume.  I was an actor in it too.
