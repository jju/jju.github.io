So I got something fun in the mail today. The latest issue of [Broken Pencil](http://brokenpencil.com), the magazine of zine culture and the independent arts. The reason this is extra fun is that I have a story in it. It's near the back, is very short and is not a real pretty story. It's called Texas Bound. Mom, you won't like it. (I like it though.)

I just kind of panicked when it came in the mail because my bio/blurb after the story mentions this here website and I realized I haven't written anything besides book reviews on here in quite some time. So, if you're here from Broken Pencil and aren't really keen on reading [all my half-assed book reviews](http://thedubiousmonk.net/tag/review/), check out my [China posts](http://thedubiousmonk.net/category/china/). They're probably the best stuff on here since the unpleasantness I'm not supposed to talk about. And I just noticed most of the links are broken on the [Journalism page](http://thedubiousmonk.net/journalism/). That's too bad. But I've got [a Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/) and [Vagabondscrawl is my linkblog](http://vagabondscrawl.tumblr.com/) if you care what I'm reading.

Anyway. I had a good day. I have a couple of book reviews that need writing, but I'll get them up tomorrow. Tonight I have Lego robots to build. On Friday I've got the day off and I am totally getting my shit together to take some decent pictures of them.
