My next post is going to be a Taoist poem I found in a book.  I'm posting it separately because I don't want to fuck around with line breaks and suchlike.  I was thinking about it while I raked today.
  

  
Lying on my (mom's) couch this evening, my eyes were momentarily unable to focus when I opened them.  I'm not sure if I'm experiencing premature enlightenment in which they are trying to see something whose visibility quotient is low, or if I'm just very tired.  I started my new job today, and I now actually deserve to lie on the couch like a lazy man (Hey Lopez!).  It's weird how different this job is already from working retail.  I'm home and I can fall in love with a book again and it's not detracting from any schoolwork I have to do.  I don't have to worry about work because I'll be doing the exact same thing maybe 300 more times over the next four months.  Make a lawn look nice.  Done, now do it again.  No real responsibility, I just have to make sure that if I'm using a machine I don't break it.  It feels much different and this is why I quit at Campaign, so that I could do something that will put me in a different mindset.  Form new pathways for the mind to wander in.
