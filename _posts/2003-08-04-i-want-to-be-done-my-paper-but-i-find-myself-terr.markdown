I want to be done my paper, but I find myself terrified of writing it.  This isn't my normal procrastination.  This is knowing the paper isn't what the prof wants but being unable to write anything other than what it is.  It's completely unacademic, and practically ahistorical and he doesn't have any input to give me.  I want to vomit every time I open the document.  I've wasted two full days so far this weekend and all I want is for it to be done.  But I've read three books (1 play, 1 novel, 1 collection of short stories) instead of working.  I got mad at myself for reading them when I was supposed to be working, but I couldn't stop.  I console myself with the fact that it is far more important to read Kundera than to write about journalists and their obsessive (and inaccurate) hyperpersonalization of censorship in the twentieth century.
