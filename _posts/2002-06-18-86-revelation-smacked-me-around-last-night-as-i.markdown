Revelation smacked me around last night as I went to sleep, sparked by a conversation had while hacking badly at the Jazz fest.  I don't have to feel anything for people just because we shared a high school.  I can hear about [heads banging off pools and fences and meatgrinders ](http://seangiesbrecht.blogspot.com)and I don't have to apologize for them or guiltily smile and acknowledge that I went to the same high school as those people.  I don't have to like them at all.  I don't have to care whether any of them die driving drunk just because we shared a graduating class.  Fuck 'em.  Now this may not seem like much, but it is a very liberating thing for me.  I've always sort of made some, no not effort, but at least feigned some interest when I saw some people at school or parties or whatever.  Asked what they were doing and so forth.  But why the fuck have I been doing that to people I don't give a shit about at all?  I don't know.  And now I've realized that I can think of those people who I went to high school with as just another bunch of fuckhead morons that I know and don't have to have any compunctions about it.

I think I've got a(nother?) decently interesting post in me somewhere, but I'll wait to share.
