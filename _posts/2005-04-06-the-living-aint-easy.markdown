Yesterday I had a major day of "I hate teaching."  It had to do with my reading class which I don't think will ever be satisfying to me or my students.  The "Those who can, do and those who can't, teach" cliche's been rolling around in my head being smarmy in that faux cliche way saying "so then those who can just shouldn't teach."  That jerk.
  

  
I keep on thinking that they need to ask questions.  My strengths come from being reactive.  That's why I was a decent student.  I'm way better at figuring things out on the fly and responding to what someone wants than telling them what they want in the first place.  How I'd like the class to go is that I give them something to read and they ask me questions about what they didn't understand.  Then I'm being useful because they're learning something.
  

  
This, of course, doesn't work when no one will admit that they don't know something.
  

  
The mean streak in me wants to show them up as liars.  When I ask "Was there anything you didn't understand?" and no one says peep.  I want to say "Great!  Summer, tell me what the author meant by 'a Napoleon complex.'" and then be all mock surprised when she can't.  Just be relentless on all the tough tricky things.  But that doesn't help anything.
  

  
On Tuesday I staggered through the first time teaching this lesson I'd planned over the weekend.  It was awful and grinding and just didn't work.  Then I had ten minutes before I had to teach it again.  In those ten minutes I rejigged the whole thing and it went much more smoothly.  That's because I was reacting to how it went the first time.  Today it went about the same.  
  

  
I'm just glad that my classes are over on Wednesdays.  I couldn't bear any more days of dreading class in a week.
  

  
Today I celebrated my TGIW by becoming reacquainted with some of my simple pleasures.  Like wearing shorts.  After my classes today I realized it was frickin' hot out and gleefully changed clothes.
