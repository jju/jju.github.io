While I've resigned myself to writing a crappy crappy story for my double weighted assignment due tomorrow morning, I must still actually do the writing.  It's far more fun putting it off though, because it will not be good.  Oh no it won't.  Luckily, I have a plan for my next one that will be good.  And I'm not all that worried about taking a hit on this story.  Really, I'm not.  Before the course started I'd had it in my head that I was going to go all highschool on this degree's ass.  I was going to do my best on everything and get really good marks and all that.  The thing about doing that is, it makes things far more stressful than I like.  I like low stress laziness.  And I've learned that I am competent enough to not get kicked out of the program if I hand in a fairly shitty story, cause my shittiness can be obscured by writing the thing well.  So all will be fine with the world.  And if I did somehow get kicked out for handing in a crappy story (keep in mind that it's going to be crappy, not Jayson Blaired, so it wouldn't happen) that's a stupid amount of tuition I wouldn't have to be paying.

In my procrastination today I've been playing the old N64.  I've podraced the shit out of those yahoos who came in here last week and erased all my high scores.  Bastards.
