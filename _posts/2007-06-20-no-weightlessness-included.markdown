[Wouldn't this be awesome](http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/06/19/mars-simulation.html)?  Too bad they don't want journalists.  Also this morning I saw a story on [cbc.ca](http://cbc.ca) about typos in a NB highschool yearbook.  Why on earth should we care that they spelled it "liturature"?  One of our yearbooks was missing an N on the cover; where was the CBC then?  Stupid.
