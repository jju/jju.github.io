Went to Jared's last night.  Excellent.  It got excellent around 1am and was still going great at 4:30 when Jared kicked us out of his backyard.  Jared must have the nicest neighbours in the world, 'cause we were loud and outside singing and yelling, and nobody called the cops.  It was a debate whether to go to bed or just to go for breakfast, but sleep won out for me.  For those who missed this (and therefore suck) by leaving too early or not coming by I'm working on getting some of the songs and stuff into MP3 format so you can be enlightened as to how much fun you missed (and therefore suck).  But no one will hear the 8 and a half minute Jailhouse Scat, until it has been severely edited (to weed out all the shit).Also, Bullfrog on Friday kicked ass.
