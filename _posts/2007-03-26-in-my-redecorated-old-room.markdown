Funny how going to your mom's house to dogsit for a week makes your brain work like you're travelling.  Funny?  I meant sad.  I can't remember the last time I left town.  
  
But it was foggy in the city today after a good times breakfast with Hassie and Jackie and folks I don't see as often as might theoretically be possible.  It still is foggy.   When I was walking here from the bus after work I was going through all sorts of strained metaphors about home and blurriness and be thankful I'm not forcing them upon you here.  
  
At work today I was organizing in the Biographies section on the second floor.  I got from Uhl to Whelan, which funny enough includes my Grandpa's book, Living in the Way.  I remember when he "wrote" that thing.  He had pages of horribly boring notes that my aunt was supposed to type up for him (I being the ten year old who'd been to mini-university got to teach her about her computer; it was the first one ever in my house).  Eventually it got typed up and passed along to a ghost writer who made it slightly less boring.  My grandma has a chapter in it, which everyone agrees is the best.  
  
I know it doesn't mean anything, but it's nice to see my surname on a book in a real library.  Yes, I'm dissing Mennonite archives there.  Wanna fight?  Didn't think so.  You may notice but I do pay attention to names.  I write under different versions of my name for a variety of reasons.  Part of that has to do with overcoming limitations in my character of Justin which get in the way of being a journalist (little things like a crippling fear of the telephone).  For a while I'd thought my writing name shouldn't have that Unrau in it.  It's not an immediately obvious name to pronounce, it's without clearly defined sounds (ie fricatives or stops - I think those are the correct linguistic terms), there's nothing attractive about it on the cover of a book.  But regardless, if whatever books I write get to sit on the shelf next to my (dickish) minister grandfather's book, at least there'll be a bit of continuity.
