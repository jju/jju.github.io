[Let Me In](http://www.librarything.com/work/662641) by John Ajvide Lindqvist is pretty freakin' great. It's a vampire novel... no wait, don't stop reading. It's not emo-vampire crap like Twilight or "Vampires are just like regular people but sexy" like True Blood. It's about a cursed monster and is suitably horrible.

Let Me In is about a vampire that moves into a suburb of Stockholm in 1981. The vampire appears to be a twelve year old girl and she has a guy who appears to be her father who goes out and harvests blood for her (which is tricky because the victim needs to be alive as it's getting bled out). He's also a pedophile who's being manipulated by the vampire's knowledge of his lusts. The main protagonist is a 12-year-old boy who is their neighbour. He gets bullied and wets himself and dreams of being able to kill his persecutors. There's also an assortment of drunks who're trying to figure out what's going on after one of their friends disappears. They're like the completely inept and unsuitable Van Helsing squad, in that they behave the way a bunch of losers would.

This (Swedish) book was turned into a (Swedish) movie, Let The Right One In, which is supposed to be scary and great and is how the book came to my attention. They're also doing an American remake of the movie (called Let Me In) which pleases me not a lot.

I'd hoped to be able to recommend this as an antidote to teens who say they like vampire novels because they read Stephenie Meyer or Darren Shan, but all the pedophilia and graphic disfigurement probably makes it way inappropriate. It's too bad though because the vampire is suitably monstrous. It reminds you there's a downside to the whole eternal life deal. Plus there's some good ol' redemptive violence to make you feel good at the end.
