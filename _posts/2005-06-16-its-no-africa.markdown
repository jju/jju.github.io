I've decided to start complaining about the heat in conversation with people here.  Not because I don't like it; I love it and believe this is my reward for that fucking winter sans heat in my apartment.
  

  
It's just that everyone wants to complain about the heat here and when a student starts a conversation with a worried look and a "How are you getting accustomed the weather?" they don't want to hear me say, "I love it.  It's awesome.  Let's have some more."  
  

  
Saying these kinds of things completely throws them off.  They have no idea how to continue from there.  And then they get tongue-tied and embarrassed and that's the end of any meaningful interaction.  If I complain then they know how to respond and continue. More importantly, they haven't been exposed as making false assumptions, which is pretty much what my cheerful contradictions do.
  

  
So I'll stifle my opinions and lie to everyone on yet another topic (the most popular being my undying love of basketball).  Someday I'll be able to say stuff without weighing everything again.
