You know why my mom's great?  Last night she took me out for Chinese food at the good place by the U of M (It was great - better HuiGuoRou than you'd occasionally get in China.  The JiaChangDouFu's pork was done differently than I expected, but the flavour was all there.  And YuXiangQieZi that wasn't overpoweringly sweet. I was really excited.) and on the way home we stopped to check something out at which point I needed to commit a bit of petty thieving.  My mom told me to go ahead.  So I did.  Yay!
