You know what my main radio problem is?  I sound too excited about bad things happening to people.  We were doing a mock newscast yesterday and it sounded like  each of the fifteen hundred people who'd been laid off from some place in Vancouver had kicked my cat and I couldn't be happier they had no jobs.  Death, terrorism, floods, all way too upbeat.  
  

  
I know why this is.  Whenever I have anything actually interesting to tell anyone, it's funny.  It's not like I talk seriously about serious issues with anyone.  We make fun of serious issues and talk seriously about stupid issues.  I hate talking seriously about serious issues.  So when I hit a story that is important I use my "hey this is important" voice, which happens to be my "hey this is funny" voice.  Things I have to work on (but just for on the air presentation; they'll remain as one in the non radio world).
  

  
In other news, I found out that Stevie G's Mariah Carey quote was never said by her.  Poor naive me.  My world is shattered.
