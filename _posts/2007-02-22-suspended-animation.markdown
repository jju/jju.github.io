It's possible you've noticed the lack of pingouink updates recently.  I think it's getting put on a hiatus for a while.  I've got other things I need to work on.  While I don't think I've exhausted the potential there, I'm feeling like it is devolving steadily.  And it's not like anyone reads it anyway.  
  
Actually, I'm finding myself drawn more and more to the backstory of the comic, the discovery and history of the unnamed French artist who got it to be a critical success.  I'll end up using the material somewhere, I'm sure.  Look for a bi-weekly drawn by me comic in the next month or two.  I'm not saying you'll find it, but look.  
  
Today at work I felt that I've got to produce something to justify my slack life right now.  My friends are talking theses, PhDs, foreign grad schools and other productive things.  While I'm stacking books.  I'm not in competition with them or anything; I just feel a bit left out.  I could be doing that, couldn't I?  I like to think I've rejected that of my own choice.  That I've chosen to be a monk in the basement, typing away when I'm not too scared to.
