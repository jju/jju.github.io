This is from an Alternet article called[The Case for Comics:](http://alternet.org/mediaculture/21520/)

<blockquote>But the facts are there, and the nightmarish surrealism seems to fit the subject matter. Indeed, the reader is forced to question the propriety of the standard journalistic conceits � the calm recitation of facts, the carefully hedged allegations, the measured tone. A drunken eagle swimming in blood may actually come closer to the point.</blockquote>

I know it's stupid to talk about the things you wish you could do but won't.  If I really wanted to do it I'd just work harder at it and get it done, right?  Well, yeah, I would.  But I'm still going to say it.  If I could draw that's the kind of journalism I'd do.
  

  
If I could draw and interview people I guess I should say.
