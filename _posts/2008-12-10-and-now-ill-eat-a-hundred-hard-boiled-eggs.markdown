I'm cold. My hands always take forever to warm up in winter. It was more annoying as a kid when I'd be going to violin lessons and have to get there ten minutes early just to run my hands under hot water so my fingers would have some semblance of movement to them. Now my fingers don't need that kind of dexterity.

My day was happily frittered away until I went to work, where it was me and Ivy and Michael who I worked with down at Millennium. That was nice. No one had left any tasks for Michael so I got him to type up rhymes. If I see another "five little somethings verbing on a something ending with the sound "ore"/ Something happened and then there were four" I will messily think about violence. I compiled a list of juvenile detective books in the Winnipeg Public Library system for the summer reading program, which is a retarded task but one I was asked to do. By who? I'm sure a regular reader could guess.
