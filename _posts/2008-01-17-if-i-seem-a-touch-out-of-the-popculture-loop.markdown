I decided after last week that the writer-less A Daily Show (and to a lesser extent Colbert) wasn't worth the pain in my psyche of watching an hour of Comedy Network each night so I've cut them from my TV habit. And with them gone it became very easy to cut everything else off too. I'll still watch sports (I do want to see the Patriots do their perfect season (or Favre deny them in the Superbowl)) but for the next while I'm mostly off television.
