[This article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251.html) in the Washington Post is about webcomics and their revenue models.  It's a pretty big deal in the webcomics community.  Like when RPGs get a big media nod, especially a non-D&D RPG.
  

  
In other news I'm going to Fuling today with the Foreign Affairs department for no particular reason.  And the power's been out since last night so my then depleted iPod is still depleted for the three hour trip.  The wake everyone up loudspeakers outside sure have electricity though.
