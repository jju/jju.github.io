Here's something I worry about sometimes, especially the day after my friends and I spent a day playing with toys and dice: if fantasy is immature, if there's something I should be doing to be more of an adult.  And then [my favourite fantasist](http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/index.html) points me to [this article by Ursula LeGuin](http://www.newstatesman.com/200612180040).

<blockquote>There should be a word - "maturismo", like "machismo"? - for the anxious savagery of the intellectual who thinks his adulthood has been impugned.  
  
To conflate fantasy with immaturity is a rather sizeable error. Rational yet non-intellectual, moral yet inexplicit, symbolic not allegorical, fantasy is not primitive but primary.</blockquote>

It doesn't address exactly the same issues, but it's a good read.
