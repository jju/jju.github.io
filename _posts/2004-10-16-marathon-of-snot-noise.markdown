Winter is getting here.  Because I'm getting cold and my nose is beginning its perpetual run.  That's the thing about winter.  It doesn't have anything to do with the actual temperature outside; it's all about whether I'm comfortable or cold.  
  
I'm cold in Winnipeg winters of -40.  I'm cold in London winters of -10 (especially when the basement apartment I spent a lot of my time was barely warmer than outside).  I wasn't cold in Goa winters of +30, but then Amritsar's +5 comes back to kick my ass.  This one'll be rainy too.  I hope it won't be too bad.  
  
I was wearing my amazing warm sweats today to try and stave off the weather but I had to go looking for a winter coat.  The only one I could find that wasn't just a flimsy piece of shit was also over 650 RMB (~$110) and I don't know whether it'll get cold enough (objectively) to justify wearing it.  Oh but it looked cozy though.  
  
Instead of buying the coat I tried an experiment.  I bought CDs at a department store to see if they were pirated too.  I mean, I assumed they would be, but they've got decent packaging if you don't look too closely at the misspelling of the "dunavrthorized/copying/hirng" warnings.  It worked out to four CDs for four dollars so I didn't feel too bad about it.  It was Bjork and Tracy Chapman because I realized that the female representation in my iTunes was sorely lacking.  And rainy days are good Tracy Chapman days.  Shut up.
