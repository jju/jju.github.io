Just for a moment there I felt like I was somewhere that was very not China.  I still haven't really looked away from the screen because I know what the room will look like again (but peripherally doesn't).  
  
Someone asked me the other day why I read so much.  "What do you get out of it?"  She'd noticed that I keep books with me and pull them out when things are going on that I don't care to be a part of.  And it's just for that.  That moment where you really feel like you aren't where you are.  Yes that's bad; you should live totally engaged with life yadda yadda yadda.  She asked just after a three hour car ride with no stereo going.  How can you not want to let your mind be somewhere else?
