I like this: [Two Kisses by Jade](http://www.pimpampum.net/phrasr/?id=3150).  Not the poem/story itself so much, but the length of it, how it turns into a tiny itty bitty film.  
  
I'm in a real miniatures kind of mood.  This afternoon I painted up a couple of figures for characters I might play in Chris' upcoming D&D game.  And they all look pretty good if I do say so myself.  
  
You're still reading [le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/) right?  
  
Sean commented on how I've become a retired man.  With my daily walks and not doing a whole lot of productive stuff.  I couldn't argue. Even if I get this library job (interview's on Wednesday) that's the kind of job a retired person would have.    
  
Couldn't argue with a lot of comments Sean made on Saturday.  Even if I shouldn't repeat them here.
