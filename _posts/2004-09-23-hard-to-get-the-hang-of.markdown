Thursdays suck.  I hate teaching three classes in a day, especially without a gap between the first two.  I came home at lunch and slept for four hours.  
  
English corner began here today.  I don't really understand how these things work.  I think it's just that people get together to speak English.  It seems like it's something I'm going to hate going to every week and will find lots of excuses to get out of.  
  
I also had to give a little speech so I talked about how they needed to learn English really well so they'd be able to laugh at the talking muffin joke, which I shared.  It's too early for the multitalented joke.
