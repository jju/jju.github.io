From [Holly's Blog](http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=hollyrinny&tab=weblogs&uid=275922274) (the quote is practically the whole post, but I'm claiming Fair Use since Holly doesn't Creative Commons her writing): 

<blockquote>Six beautiful freshman came over in the afternoon.  We were delighted with each others' company.  At five I showed them the half-filled pot of leftover rice and beans and invited them to stay for dinner.  I replenished the cucumbers in the cucumber salad, and they whipped up a fried egg and tomato dish and bought some baozi (steamed buns).  I desperately want my home to be welcoming place . . . and feel it's starting to swing that way.</blockquote>

See, I can sort of understand why a person might want that.  It was drilled into our heads last summer that we were supposed to be hospitable and respond well to Chinese people's hospitality and all that.  And it seems like on some scale of values I'd probably subscribe to "hospitable" is better than "private."  And I've been trying.  
  
But for me at the end of the day (hell, at the end of the hour) it always comes down to "Get the hell out of my house."   
  
(Unless we are way better friends than I am with anyone here in Wanzhou.  Which probably includes like 80% of the people reading this, so no knickertwisting; I'm not talking about you).  
  
Stories like Holly's from above don't happen here, mainly because I am a very poor host.  I like meeting people in places I am familiar with but are not mine.  My home is not for strangers.  I think the big part of that is because my space is arranged for me and my convenience.  Since I am here by myself and don't have to share any of that space, it has been made very functional for my usual sets of activities, which do not include dining or conversation.    
  
Because it's all so functional letting people in here lets them see far more of me than I might otherwise tell them.  I took a few archaeology courses; I know what people can discover from looking at the trash.  
  
I realize I moan about all my friends being 6 hours or more away so I should be welcoming and hospitable when students come to call.  These visitors are people who are here and want to hang out with (or at least bribe with watermelons into letting their friend pass her course on the third try) me.  I should take what I can get and maybe we will become really good friends.  
  
But as soon as they're here I want them to get out of my space.  
  
I suppose this is all that "only-children are selfish gits" stuff coming through eh?  Selah.
