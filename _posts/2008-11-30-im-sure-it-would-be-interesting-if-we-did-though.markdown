**Boy:** Does anyone here have a DS?

**Justin:** I don't know if we've got any books about...

**Boy:** No. A DS (he waves his portable video game thingy around). Does anyone have one?

**Justin:** Umm no we don't have one here at the desk, but the computers...

**Boy:** Well, does anyone else here in the library have one then?

**Justin:** Yeah, I don't know. We don't inventory people's pockets when they come into the library.

**Boy:** (wanders away)

**Justin:** (marks down the question on reference log)
