Nothing like getting a haircut to make you feel more like yourself.  My hair hadn't been trimmed since November so with the warm weather it was time to shave it off.
  

  
The sad thing about it is I no longer fit my Nanchong image.  Remember Fido Dido from the 7Up ads back in the early 90s?  Well he's alive and well here in China.  All over everything.  One of Holly and Dan's friends in Nanchong decided to refer to me as their "friend who looks like a cartoon character" because of my standy-uppy hair, which resembled said character.  I enjoyed the idea of looking like a cartoon a lot, and I could get into some Scott McCloud stuff about why, but it doesn't really matter.
  

  
Now that hair's all gone and I fear I'll disappoint the Nanchongren dreadully when I show up looking as if I just got off a bus instead of a can of pop.
