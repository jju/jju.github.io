Well, I wrote my next to last exam yesterday which was a nonstop gateau-stomp.  I'm going to read a few articles for my last exam tomorrow and all will be well with my world.
  

  
Also, I paid for our tickets yesterday.  You know what I like?  I like the travel agent that helped us with all that stuff.  She was really helpful and friendly.  Her name is Cathy and if anyone is using Travel Cuts at the UofM, I heartily recommend her.
  

  
I've been told that the thing that keeps readership on these dealies is hardcore ranting.  I don't have anything to rant about at this moment, however.  Oh, how about this: Holland America (the cruise line) in its brochures goes on and on about how their "Filipino and Indonesian crew" are so wonderful and will entertain you on their cruises wit their traditional dances and such, and don't worry, you've only got to tip them three dollars a day!  It seems weird to me that they would be so public about their exploitative hiring practices, while also publicizing the fact that the captains and all that kind of crew are Dutch.  It's just a weird use of ethnicity that doesn't sit right with me.  Or something.
