Remember how I was talking about cars the other day?  Well, it seems those Natural Gas taxis I mentioned they have here in Wanzhou might be making their way to North America.  Read [this story](http://www.worldchanging.com/cgi-bin/mt-tb.cgi/1687) at [worldchanging.com](http://www.worldchanging.com):


<blockquote>Despite Ford’s cancelling of its US CNG auto line, and GM’s reduction of domestic models, Honda is pushing forward with consumer sales of its natural gas Civic GX. Honda is also trialing a home CNG fueling system, called Phill. (GCC) Natural gas vehicles are seeing a surge in use internationally, and especially in transit fleets. Many see CNG helping lay the infrastructure for hydrogen fueling.</blockquote>


Maybe I'll bring a taxi home as the souvenir for my mom.
