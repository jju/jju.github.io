Warren Ellis is producing actual original content at [die puny humans](http://diepunyhumans.com/) this week:

"My friend Patrick Stewart stars as Swing, a part which he performs entirely naked for the whole three-hour running time. The soundtrack for GET SWING! is to be created by The Flaming Lips, by arrangement with their manager Scott Booker. There is a glorious moment near the end where the band burst into "Do You Realise" as Patrick kills Augusto Pinochet by screwing a sharpened wine glass into his chest, coring out his heart, and a flock of angels rise out of the ring of burning threshing machines surrounding them, take out long slim feathered penises, and piss blood all over his body."
