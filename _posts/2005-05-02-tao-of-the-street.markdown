Okay, let the media blitz begin.  It's not much of a blitz.  France has nothing to fear or surrender to.

[INTHEFRAY Magazine](http://inthefray.com/html/article.php?sid=1128&mode=thread&order=0) just published a bunch of my pictures and an accompanying essay about China.  Sadly, one of [my favourite](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/1777101/) pictures in the group got cut due to the picture quality, but that's what happens when you're using a little point and shoot I guess.

It was an interesting process to get all this done.  I originally responded to a call for submissions on the theme "Belonging."  I had some ideas for some pictures that would work on that theme from Tibet.  The Image editor and I bounced emails back and forth and she picked a bunch of different ones that spanned a bigger area but were still on the belonging theme.  I said I could start writing the essay right away, but she asked me to hold off for a bit.

I didn't hear anything for a while and the "Belonging" issue floated on by.  Then a couple of weeks ago she emailed back with a new selection of pictures, and asked for something on street life in China.  So that was cool.

I wrote the essay you can see there and some captions for the pictures, bounced them between us a couple of times and there they are.  It was weird working with an editor again.  On all this blog stuff, I'm the only one that looks at these things before shooting them out there.  I realized how much I tend to under-write things here and just assume people know what I'm talking about.  That's something I forget you can't do in non-blogging journalism, and my editor, Alisa Troetschel, fixed all that stuff up nicely.

There are some things that , some of the captions are a bit different from what I'd written, and I'm not entirely sure about some of the choices of pictures, but that's what happens when you're writing for real.

So now that line on my resume that says Photographer isn't just empty hooha.  I have published photgraphs.  Not that that's impressive to any of my real journalist friends, but at least my mom thinks I'm cool.

You think I'm cool, right mom?
