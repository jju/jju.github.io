I worked Info/Ref on Saturday and it was pretty fun. They get a bit more variety in what people ask for. Well, not variety in form I guess, but somehow it feels a bit more satisfying dealing with their questions. Or maybe I just like doing something different. 

One guy I helped was looking first for Old English lettering and then once we found a good typography book he wanted to know where the books on snakes were. He was so planning a tattoo. 

And there was a lady who almost got mad at me when a book that the computer said was checked in wasn't. She was an older woman looking for information on Rheumatoid Arthritis and Plantar Fasciitis and had called about those topics earlier. She seemed a little confused when I asked her if someone had put a book aside for her, saying "Oh yes that's very nice." It quickly was determined that no one had. We quickly found the arthritis books but the lone book in Horizon that mentioned plantar fasciitis wasn't on the shelf. This was when she got annoyed so I asked her to wait while I looked for something else. Eventually I found books on pain relief that had nothing specific to PF but more importantly I grabbed some podiatry books which did. And the rejoicing deafened all those around us. Or not.

And I got to work in the Local History Room for an hour. I didn't have to answer any questions and spent my time reading My Winnipeg since they didn't have any tasks for me to do. It was a nice time. Very quiet.

Yesterday back at Special Services, I met one of our Print Handicapped patrons and helped her get some audio books. She's a British lady, probably in her 80s, who gets jokes. She and Bruce traded banter slowly. She just takes a moment to hear and it almost feels like she's translating what people say before she responds with a pretty sharp, sort of random kind of joke back. Very neat. We found her some Margaret Atwood books (because she feels she's finally ready to try reading her after so many years hearing her name) and a biography of "a man whose name I don't want to say too loudly  - Pierre Elliott Trudeau."
