Today I was in a class for the first time in quite a while. It was an LSA training class and was something I could have gotten in about a quarter the time had it been a less formal instructional kind of thing but whatever. It made me realize how much I miss being in a class. Learning things. It didn't matter that this shit was bone simple computer stuff. It was fun to be in a room with an instructor who diverged off into stories about patrons claiming they'd been abducted and dropped their books in the Amazon and that's why their books were not going to be returned. I really miss learning things instead of just mucking about in my own head all the time.

Also, how does a person, not an 80 year old person mind you, but a 40 something year old, get through life in this millennium without knowing something about computers? There was one woman in our class today who had evidently never seen one of these glowing boxes before. Her problems weren't with anything tricky, but stuff like "What do you mean, Caps...Lock?" or not understanding what clicking "OK" means. I was so glad I wasn't sitting next to her or I'd have felt bad for not helping her. As it was our supervisor had to come over and guide her through each step of anything he asked us to do ever. I'm sure he was glad she didn't work in our branch.
