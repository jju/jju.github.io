"So.  Are ya Riders fans?"

He was a big man doing a dance.  It involved shuffling backwards next to slow moving cars, grinning like an Indonesian bomber, and asking a simple question.  He'd drank a dozen beers in the past couple of hours and he was sweating off the facepaint.  It was almost the end of the Labour Day Classic.

This was long after we'd used his truck to lurk in the reeds next to the Trans Canada highway, only to burst out and chase a Civic that was also on its way from Winnipeg to Regina.  There we were, in a mechanical Bomber loving predator pouncing from the ditch, flying our flag, losing our crown, and the bastards in the Civic didn't even notice.

It was before another of our exploits was mentioned in the Winnipeg Free Press for the second time.  Just past the Manitoba Saskatchewan border there's a sign welcoming the casual motorist to Riderville.  When we saw activity by the sign we had to help.  One of us donated a roll of duct tape (which would later be used in a fit of violence) to help secure a "Go Blue" banner over the billboard.  While we helped (or gawked in a stoned silence) our football team passed by in its bus.  Inspirational is what we were.  Then we drove on a golf course, honking and screaming.

The dance came 18 hours after an impromptu parade down Regina's main streets flying that Bomber flag on the end of a golf ball retriever.  Police ended the parade by promising custody to protect the paradists from the savage beating they were heading for if they didn't shut up.

It was only a few hours after he'd sung the worst song in the world ("That Cocksucking Bumfucking Regina Whore!") while standing in line with a pile of children, and scant minutes since singing the best song in the world ("Cause Rough Riders Suck Cock!") to saddened folks in green.

He almost got into a fight, which he would have lost, a few minutes after he stopped dancing.  His friends pulled him back and he drank from a jug of rye.  Not necessarily in that order.

While he danced though you could see why we came.  Sure we're dumb, loud, and oh so gay, but we're happy.

Bombers 36.  Riders 18.
