Today I figured out part of why this whole not-working-at-Special-Services-yet thing is wearing me down so much. I want to know what my schedule actually is going to be, when I might get a weekend to go to Calgary or what have you. As it stands I'm working all the weekends in January but since I might leave Sir William Stephenson at any time I can't really count on the next rotation of my long-weekend to actually be my weekend off at Special Services. So I can't plan for shit. And the whole not knowing if I'll be pulling in as many hours down there thing means I feel like I should be taking shifts while the taking is good. Get my money's worth out of this bus pass and all.

There's also the thing that it's been a month and a half since I was hired for my new job. I mentally checked out of this one weeks ago. I want to be learning something new, get the hang of the new place instead of just counting down hours at Sir William. I feel a bit like I'll never be released. I mean, they can't take my Special Services job away from me or anything but I feel like no one in the world will ever want to fill my position and I'll still be here years from now waiting for the umpteenth rebulletinning for some poor sucker to take my place.
