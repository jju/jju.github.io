I've decided I'm recuperated and am heading to Hong Kong this weekend.  Against my better judgement I'm considering making a reservation for a cheap (for HK) bed.  But that will require a series of travel connections to actually work, which I have no idea if that is an impossible dream or not.  In any case I'm leaving here on Sunday.  I think this trip'll be low tech for me.  I don't want to have to worry about the minidisc or the videocamera this time.  Camera and iPod only.  The bigger debate is over what coat I'll wear.  Because there's a boat trip involved that could be chilly, but I don't want to have to carry a coat around and not use it once I get out to the coast.

Wow.  I'm sorry.  This is horribly boring.

Today on a walk I stumbled into the asshole of the city.  And the city's got the spattering shits.  I'm not sure that's entirely true, but I did find a waterfall of brown reekiness behind a bunch of half destroyed buildings.  The stream ran out to the river.  I realized I have no idea how the sewage disposal works in this city.  Is it possible that it was what it looked/smelled like?  Je ne sais pas.

There you go.  Exotic waste disposal mysteries.  That makes up for banal domestic details.
