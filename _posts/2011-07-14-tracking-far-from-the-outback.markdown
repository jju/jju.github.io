![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-medcIUAfVNE/Th5ngq9xThI/AAAAAAAAAcY/5ToqnCLWYpA/s912/IMAG0044.jpg)Holly's very into the jobhunt. They do this whole "job trial" thing here which is deeply annoying. They keep on bringing her into places for a few hours to work and then don't call her back. Kind of a dick move. But it's a big city and there are lots of people looking for work I guess. She's pretty awesome about keeping on going even though it's tough.

Today she went on an hour train ride north and back as part of this whole process. I can't tell you why, or what she returned with, but I can post this picture she took from the train.
