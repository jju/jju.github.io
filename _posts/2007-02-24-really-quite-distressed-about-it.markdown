My Kid Koala toque which I loved is gone.  I put it in my locker at work and when I left it wasn't there.  It's not that it was stolen maliciously.  Some new girl was there today and had put her stuff in my locker as well.  I assume she picked up my toque as part of her things and has now given it to her dog to chew on, or flung it into the street to get repeatedly run over in the slop.
