One might think that once exams were created it would be a simple matter to get them printed.  Nope.  Because they need to be put into special forms for questions and answers and keys and all in Chinese and then you realize you've flipped the questions and the key around and have to go back and reformat the whole thing again.  And you know you will still get looks like you're an idiot because you can't remember which characters correspond with the year of the students (because all the characters you know for number or year are nowhere to be found).
  

  
And two and a half hours standing around at English corner doesn't really help.  Though I did get away with not having to participate in any games, and one of my first years that I really like spent time chatting which diluted the first year I don't like's time talking.  Yay me!
