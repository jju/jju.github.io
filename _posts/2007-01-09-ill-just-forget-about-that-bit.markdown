I care about the environment, the planet, all that, but I hate the sacrifices I'd have to go through to really do something about it.  What kind of sacrifices?  [Here's an article full of them.](http://www.alternet.org/envirohealth/46318/)  The biggest for me though, the one that strikes hardest at my identity or something are the emissions from flying. 

<blockquote>Monbiot reluctantly concludes, "(T)here is simply no way of tackling this issue other than reducing the number, length and speed of the journeys we make." ...  
  
He urges his readers "to remember that these privations affect a tiny proportion of the world's people. The reason they seem so harsh is that this tiny proportion almost certainly includes you."</blockquote>

I guess if you didn't care about seeing the world that wouldn't be a problem.  And maybe if I were growing up in twenty years and had hi-res everything of different places on the net it'd be different.  But giving up the rest of the world for places I could bike to?  I don't think I could do that.
