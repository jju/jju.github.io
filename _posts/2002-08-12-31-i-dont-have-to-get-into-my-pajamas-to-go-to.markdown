I don't have to get into my pajamas to go to bed tonight, cause I never got out of them all day.  I filled myself with waffles when I woke up at 1 this afternoon, ate some corn this evening, and spent the rest of decadent and depraved day not at the Kentucky Derby but reading a mediocre scifi novel that I got for free.  Sweetness.
