(I suppose I've been counting full days left.  Hm.  Really, this hasn't been a 911 countdown.  I swear.  Profusely.)

_For each age is a dream that is dying

Or one that is coming to birth_

- an Unknown Armies tagline

You know what's good?  Eating ice cream out of a trough with your buddies.  And being childish enough that you have to step back from the trough because you're laughing too hard at Ren's mom saying that she figured that everybody just had to eat a good 8 inches.  And making fun of Jared in such a way that other people (who aren't used to statements like "I'm Jared! I'm so great!" in a big loud man voice) get pissed off at you, but not Jared, 'cause he's a cool guy.  I go out for supper with my mom tonight, then do something with the guys tomorrow.
