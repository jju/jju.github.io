Alison's been gone for a week.  The main floor is a mess because of her absence.  Not that she keeps it clean, but because I'm considerate of other people and try to stay out of their way.  (Unless we are discussing [the former roommate who could be the subject of a children's book](http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07262007).)  This has been on my mind since I also raided her DVDs and watched the 13 episodes that were Twitch City.  I don't think I'd ever seen the second season of that show before.  And since it was a CBC show not based on current events I'm sure it only returned after a multiyear gap.  The first season is way better than the second.  Like by a lot.  Yep.  
  
Maybe this'll unclog Blogger.
