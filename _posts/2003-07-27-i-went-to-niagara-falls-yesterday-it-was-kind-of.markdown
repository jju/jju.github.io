I went to Niagara Falls yesterday.  It was kind of funny how after a short spurt of barrel related conversation, things went back to standard tropes.  I mean, how much can you talk about a couple of big waterfalls?  Not very much it turned out.

In other news I'm hoping that radio will get to be much more fun this week.  Last week was all lectures that were sort of weak.  And when I say sort of, I mean immensely.  Supposedly the lectures were much more interesting if you smoked up before class.
