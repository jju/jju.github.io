Ha!  That went much quicker than I expected.  My script for an 8-page comic called _Tradition_ is now complete.  This is the one I'm going to use as one of my sample scripts for my portfolio.  It's an adaptation of a short story I wrote years ago.  I'm now looking at a concept I'd been working on back then and trying to figure out if it'd work better as a 96-page graphic novel than as regular old prose.  So far it's looking like it would.
