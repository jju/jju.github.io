I just got back from visiting my very first Chinese Buddhist temple.  Man, do I hate being in a big group.  That's why I'm back now.  I am not a big fan of group decision making, group walking, group listening, any of that stuff.  Of course the problem is that I can't really get anywhere on my own, knowing only a tiny smidgen of Chinese.  I'm going to do some research on the Beijing transit system so I can get somewhere by myself this week.
  

  
We took cabs last night and it went all right.  But I must admit I still am uneasy around them.  The Middle East did that to me and then India put the nail in the coffin.  They use meters here and only charge by the kilometre, not the waiting time so it seems like it'd work out.  I still don't like it though.  I like going places in walking distance, which in Beijing is sadly nowhere.
  

  
We took those cabs to Wangfujing and back.  It's the big shopping district downtown.  "So here's where all the Chinese people have been hiding" went through my mind 'casue there were a lot of them.  I've been missing the crowds of India.  Not missing in a fond reminiscence kind of way but feeling their absence.  But it sure doesn't feel like a communist country down there.  It feels like any generic big city apart from the signage.  Lots of lights, it's clean, McDonalds on every corner.  I'm looking forward to Wanzhou where things might not be quite the same.
