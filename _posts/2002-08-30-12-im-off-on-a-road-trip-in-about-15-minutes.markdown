12
  

  
I'm off on a road trip in about 15 minutes.  Mmmm Cake.  Poor suckers who still had CDs to make last night at 1am while I lay dreaming (so they could all die screaming).
  

  
I reread Watchmen yesterday.  So good.  And I was so wrong to ever suggest the Coen brothers to do a movie version.  Now I'm leaning more towards Terry Gilliam.  As a movie, I think I'd do it as primarily the Rorshach story, leave out some of the backstory.  I mean you'd refer to the Minutemen but there wouldn't be the same sort of in depth stuff with them and the rape and stuff.
  

  
Update on the road trip to show up on Monday some time.  Happy long weekend!
