I'm in Wanzhou and I've gotten through all the important work.  ie I tested all my PS2 games I just bought to see how many were in so much Japanese they'd be annoying.  Happily it was only two.  Unhappily they included the baseball game.
  

  
Now I've watched Napoleon Dynamite.  Finally.  That was a great movie but of the movies that I've finally seen that I've had a lot of buildup for I probably like I [Heart] Huckabees a bit more.  That said, I haven't watched Napoleon Dynamite 18 billion times yet so we'll see how it goes.  I'm sure it will only get better.
