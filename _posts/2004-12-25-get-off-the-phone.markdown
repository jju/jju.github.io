I was told tonight by the vice president of the university something that people have been saying for years upom years, that people wear masks and that only under the influence of alcohol do we remove those masks and reveal our true selves.  
  
So it appears that the true Justin has a poor sense of balance and is still too quiet for his own damned good.  
  
I was baijiued six times in twenty minutes which contributed a lot to that.  It's raining now and I must say that I love all of you.  Especially those who don't read this.
