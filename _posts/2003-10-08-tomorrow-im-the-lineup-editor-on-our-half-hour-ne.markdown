Tomorrow I'm the lineup editor on our half hour newscast.  Basically that means I decide which story goes where in the show.  It's a tricky job, because you have to get your pacing and everything going just fine.  Luckily I've got lots of stories to work with, including my feature which worked out okay after all that hassle.  I got my final interview this morning which was a bit scary.  I knew I needed a fifteen second sound bite from this woman that didn't trample all over my script.  She gave me 14 seconds and 28 frames that lightly kissed my script's toes.  It was sweet like borscht ain't.
