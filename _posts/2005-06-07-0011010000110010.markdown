I finally bought a little 64MB USB flash drive this afternoon.  This means my arduous process of printing things got the "emailing the file to myself then connecting the Windows box to the net (and a power source) so I can download and put the file on a disk to bring down to the office" steps cut right out.  Very nice.
  

  
And it came with a neck cord thing so I can wear my stylish blue data holder as a fashion statement.  So many people here wear their cell phones around their necks I was feeling left out.
  

  
It's just a backup of my important documents (resume, webpages, portfolios) but it makes me very happy.  Like I'm actually living in the 21st century.  It's like all those scifi stories and games where people have little memory sticks with all sorts of information on them.  That they could leave behind in a coffee shop for the heroes to discover.  Hilarity ensues.  
  

  
iPods and the Internet weren't things I'd thought about when I was seven.  These kinds of memory sticks were.
