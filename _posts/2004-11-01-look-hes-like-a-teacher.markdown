Marking marking marking.  It's so sad reading these exams 'cause everything that's remotely good I have to put in the "cheat" pile since I'll find the exact same words a few papers later.  Even with all the cheating (which I realize is a cultural difference kind of thing that I should be tolerant of, but it annoys the hell out of me) the best mark in the class so far is 45/60.  Yeah, I have to change something in how I teach the sophomores.    
  
The seniors don't mind so much sometimes but they're all gone now.  They're being taken away to various villages and cities around to do their practice teaching so they can get a good job teaching for the rest of their lives.  Thank everything that is good in this world that I won't have to go on doing this for the rest of my life.
