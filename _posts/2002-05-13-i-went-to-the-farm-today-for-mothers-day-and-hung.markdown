I went to the farm today for mother's day and hung out with my ten year old cousin.  My favourite bit of the day was telling her that I wouldn't go out into the middle of the field because I was scared of fields, because you never know just when one end'll come loose and the wind'll catch it and roll up like one of those nonvenetian blinds with you in the middle.  If Stevie G is missing the profanity in this post, I'm just saying, "Dude, it's Sunday (and Mother's Day to boot)."
  
Read my last post because I really like the question about who would be writing people I know, and I want to see some answers, damnit!  Oh fuck, back to hell with me.
