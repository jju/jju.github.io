Okay, just in case anyone reads this anymore and hasn't been getting my email updates, here's the deal.

The trip is progressing well.  I crashed a scooter in Cappadocia, and we've had a couple of things stolen, but all in all, we're doing fine.  We've now been to Istanbul, Bursa, Cannakale, Gallipoli, Troy, Selcuk, Ephesus, Pammukale, Bodrum, Butterfly Valley, Kas, Olympos, Antalya, Goreme, Mustafapas (scooter crash site), Nevsehir, Antakya, Aleppo, Khirbet Qanafar, Baalbek, Zahle, Beirut, the Jeitta Grotto, Harissa, Byblos, the Chouf Cedars, Tripoli, Bcharre, Hama, the Krak des Chevaliers, Musyaf, Damascus, Amman, the Dead Sea, Mount Nebo, Madaba, Wadi Musa, Petra, the Wadi Rum, Aqaba, Tarabin, Nuweiba, Mount Sinai, Dahab, the Suez Canal, Luxor, the Valley of the Kings, the Valley of the Queens, the Ramesseum, Aswan, Abu Simbel, the Nile, Kom Ombo, Edfu, Alexandria and Cairo.  How have you spent your last three months?
