My new (cheap) computer arrived yesterday and I've got Windows 7 and Linux up and running. It's funny how Windows is easier in some ways (I've been installing programs and the Windows locations make more sense to me through familiarity) but any temptation to just stick with Windows 7 is stabbed by the fact I can't change my background image. It's a "disabled feature" in Windows 7 Starter to encourage you to upgrade. Sigh. I upgraded to Ubuntu where that shit isn't a problem.

Anyway, since I charged it up yesterday I've been working on battery power and being happy with it. This'll be a fine school laptop. Much better than an iPad. And the figuring everything out is kind of fun. Makes my brain feel a bit sharper. So I'm a 3 OS person now. Whee!
