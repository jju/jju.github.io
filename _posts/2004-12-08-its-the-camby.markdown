I'm celebrating being done creating exams by reading the archives of webcomics.  This one doesn't explain [why we go to the Camby](http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=37) (well maybe it does, I've just never thought of it in those terms) but I like it because the construction guy looks like Neville.
