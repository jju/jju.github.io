I saw [Ray](http://imdb.com/title/tt0350258/) yesterday and I thought it was okay but not spectacular.  I know this is a problem with doing a biopic, because it's a real person's life, but there wasn't any real tension or resolution or anything to it.  It just seemed like a TV movie with better acting (cause Jamie Foxx did a great job).  Maybe part of it was how quickly music made hostile crowds love him.  It's like they'd never seen a show with an unappreciative audience.  There were these constant instant transformations that never felt earned.  
  
Just for the record, the only Oscar I care about this year is Original Screenplay, which had better go to [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://imdb.com/title/tt0338013/).
