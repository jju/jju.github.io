I like it when distinguished foreign guests come to town.  I eat much classier.

Andrew Eggman is here from the States for a week, giving some lectures and things.  So we got to go out for dinner last night, and lunch this afternoon.  He knows a bunch of the people in the English department because they went to the US last year.  So they have their own in jokes involving calling each other the Gang of Four, and arguing over who gets to be Mao.  I was included this afternoon when Mr. Wang said I was Karl Marx.  Which if I have to be some major figure in Communist Chinese history I can live with.

Eggman was making a joke about this stuff last night and said "So after I resigned from the Gang of Four I fled to Taiwan."  The van got quiet and one of the teachers explained that when he talks to students he can't make comments like that.  They were all a little freaked out.  But he said he fled to Hong Kong instead, and everyone relaxed.
