I was telling Reyn and Sean about this last night, but do you remember James Frey, the Million Little Pieces guy?  Wrote a memoir of coming up from the bottom of druggishness and all that.  He was on Oprah.  And then he was outed as a liar who'd made it all up.  




Million Little Pieces remains in the nonfiction section of the Millennium Library.
