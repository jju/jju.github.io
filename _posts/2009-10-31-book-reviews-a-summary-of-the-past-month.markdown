I've been reading, but not a lot, and for some reason haven't been real keen on writing everything up as I finish it. Here's what I can remember since the last review. 

Recently I finished Shadow & Claw the first two volumes of Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun tetralogy. A classic and one I'm enjoying. It's got short chapters which help you not feel like you're slogging through stuff. 

I read The Moor's Last Sigh just before the Salman Rushdie thing. It was the last of his novels I hadn't read and good. I feel like I've said this before about some other book but it feels like the novel is an excuse to get the backstory out there. We need to read the story of Moraes' grandparents' love story to know anything about him. It's interesting to consider in light of SR's notions of the role of the novel today.

Deadeye Dick by Kurt Vonnegut was found at a used bookshop a few weeks ago and devoured in an afternoon. Have I mentioned that I got the first volume of Alan Moore's run on Swamp Thing? The new edition that has his first story on the title in it, not just the beginning of his first arc. Also read Rilke's Letters To A Young Poet, and today I finished Nick Abadzis' amazing comic Laika, which was heartbreaking.
