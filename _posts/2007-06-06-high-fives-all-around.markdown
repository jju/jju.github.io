Steve the cat killed a goddamned pigeon this evening while I was on the phone.  Cheers to him, though he didn't really know what he was doing.  It was a series of approaches, swats, and retreats on a wounded ratbird that seemed thoroughly amateurish.  No killer instinct, not even a semblance of clean kill or good honest savagery.  I remain unaware how the was first brought down to be manhandled in such a pathetic display.
