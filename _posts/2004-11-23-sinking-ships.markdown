So, I say I should blog more serious stuff and what shows up in my inbox but The Pengyou Press?  This particular issue contains an article of mine in which I expose a huge Chinese state secret.  Huge!  And just for you, I've popped it into the Journalism section under its title of [Pass Djibouti on the Left](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/journalism.html#djibouti).  
  
If anyone asks, you didn't hear it from me.
