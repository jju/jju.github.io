The first week and a bit (half?) of my last chunk of school has been very relaxing.  I've fixed up my paper to get out of the 0 incident, and it was ridiculous how little I had to do.  John Stackhouse (the foreign editor from the Globe & Mail) gave our international reporting class a talk on Tuesday.  Sadly, he said that foreign editors don't want to be told that you're going somewhere and would they like anything.  They want to be pitched with stories written on spec when you're out in the country in question.  Which makes having a way of paying your rent and ticket to somewhere interesting that much more important.

I'm doing radio this term, not TV.  I realized that I wanted to have a bit of fun and not kill myself doing a TV documentary.  So radio it is.  And it's easier to freelance for radio than for television.

Oh, obviously I made it back to fakeLondon okay.  It's spring here.  Comparatively.
