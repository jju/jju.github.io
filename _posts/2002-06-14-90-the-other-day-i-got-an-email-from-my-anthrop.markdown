The other day I got an email from my anthropology friend about his crazy ass year coming up.  He's spending the summer on a dig 6 hours north of Irkurtsk in Russia with everything he's going to need in his backpack.  They're excavating 25 late neolithic burials.  He is one of those guys who gives every impression of doing exactly what he wants to be doing.  In fall he's going to Sheffield in England, which was the only grad school he applied to.  But he's not one of these pricks who shows off.  I know he wasn't the top academic in our class, but man, that guy puts in effort to learn stuff with a kind of high energy laidbackness, that just makes you feel bad when you know he's got things wrong.  Dean Moriarity had Dale's face for me.  Really cool guy.  His email got me thinking about who I know now that I'm going to make an effort to remain in contact with for the unforseeable future.  It worked out to about 10 people, which was more than I expected.

I read a scene in This Side of Paradise at lunch today which I swear has happened to me.  Not in details or even the flow of the thing, just the vague nature of the scene.  The bare skeleton of a situation made it, a scene which could have felt a million different ways, felt exactly the same to me although every detail and motivation was ultimately different.  Mmm.
