I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit I only just read Michael Chabon's [The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay](http://www.amazon.ca/Amazing-Adventures-Kavalier-Clay-Novel/dp/0312282990/) now. It's been such a fixture in the bookstores for years. It won the Pulitzer Prize. And it's about comic books. I should have been all over this. But things get in the way and I was reading other things, knowing it was good but not reading it (though letting people assume I had).

I finished it this morning and it was so so good. In comparing it to [The Yiddish Policemen's Union](http://www.amazon.ca/Yiddish-Policemens-Union-Michael-Chabon/dp/0007149832/) I probably prefer Kavalier & Clay but that's because I know comics better than I know Alaska and Jewishness so I could see the research playing out. I loved that they were just nestled in the middle of the real publishers and characters. Also, since this one wasn't a detective story it didn't have that detective story kind of arc. I loved that it jumped 12 years in the middle. I loved that there wasn't a falling out over money. I loved the Antarctica chunk. I don't really want to see it become a movie.
