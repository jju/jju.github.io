My favourite Folk Fest moment was Friday night when I was fulfilling my role as Pancho's trusty sidekick and we came to the basin in front of the hill and the cloud was on a level about a half metre off the ground.  Pancho and I kneel down to observe and then discuss.  Then he says "The cloud's gone now.  We're just two weirdos hunched in a field."  And we walked off.

I keep forgetting that our campsite had a giant trojan rabbit on Saturday night.  I also loved the silhouettes of Poncho, Pancho and Patcho (and hangers on) in the fog lit up by the moon just before we did that unnerving jogaround.  So good.
