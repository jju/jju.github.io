Sometimes I read what people write on internet message boards and forums and such.  And I always [feel bad afterwards](http://somethingpositive.net/sp02272005.shtml).  Like baby Jesus crying while his mom slides down a pole with her legs around her neck and old leather-clad Joe's hitting on the gimp-masked bouncer bad.
