Some people who read this blog may know that a digital movie is in the works from Hungry J productions.  Its actors will be small and plastic, with yellow bumpy heads.  Tentatively, it is going to be about Jive Talkin' Ninja Robots who travel back in time . . . for some reason.  Perhaps it will star a talking pie; I don't know.  The point is that we are currently soliciting ideas for things that people want to see in a short (probably around 5 minute) movie about Jive Talkin' Ninja Robots.  Think of it as one of those focus groups that make Hollywood movies all sort of the same, but cool.  We'll weed out the shitty suggestions, and then think that some of the shitty suggestions are excellent and include them.  In any case, people who give us good ideas get writing credits (or gaffer credits if they prefer - we aren't planning on needing a lot of electrical work done.  Ah hell, they'll get whatever credits aren't taken if they want 'em.  But just one per person.) for the movie, and all the fame and glory that goes along with it.  So think about Jive Talkin' Ninja Robots who travel back in time . . . for some reason.  The time they're travelling back to is going to be a medievalish period.  There will possibly be time rangers chasing them back in time, or the castle dwellers may mount their own spirited resistance.  I'm leaving it open for your ideas (though I have a basic plot laid out and am working on the script).  So, cool ideas!
  

  
In other news, my filling at the dentist took 15 minutes today.  I was amazed.  And you can eat right after wards.  You can't eat after letting flouride sit in contact with your teeth for a minute, but let them drill a hole in your tooth and patch it up and you're good to go.  Bizarre.
  

  
Oh.  Cold Cold Ground is going up tonight.  Listen.  It's all good.
