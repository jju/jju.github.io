I took a day off work today. Not library work but writing work. I'm done Part One (of Six?) of my morning-writing fiction project (~13000 words so far) and I'm a bit ahead of schedule. And I just watched [this Bruce Sterling video](http://www.vimeo.com/769193/l:embed_769193) which has everything to do with what I'm writing there it's not even funny. Seriously so happy I watched it. You might not want to because it's 40 minutes long, but whatever.

I also watched the Habs game and read a bit of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, which I really like but have problems losing myself in for hours at a time.
