I read this book, [Cairo](http://www.amazon.ca/Cairo-G-Willow-Wilson/dp/1401217346/), at work the other day. It's a comic about a few young people doing stuff in contemporary Cairo. There's a djinn and an accidental Israeli spy, travels to the Under-Nile, a hookah, gangsters, you know. Not bad, though I wouldn't actually buy it. It killed a break pretty well. My favourite aspect was the under-river because it reminded me of My Winnipeg's under-Forks.
