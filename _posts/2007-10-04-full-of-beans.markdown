Remember how I said writing today would go much better? It did. My mood control technique of getting cool shit done works again. The bad news is that the story I was hoping to finish a draft of by the end of the week will not be finished. The good news is that it's because the story is much bigger than I'd first imagined and requires a completely different way of looking at it. The original story has kind of morphed into a treatment, like a summary of the bigger thing. And it looks like it's all going to be part of something even bigger.

I love having multiple things to work on so when one area becomes a fetid swamp of idiocy (as the Menno History novel recently did) my stuff can divert into altogether new areas. Not altogether new. Just different channels.
