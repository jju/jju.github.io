What good are principles if you won't break them when you need to?
  

  
One of my ways of dealing with the profusion of stupid cheap DVDs here in China has been to refrain from buying any movie I'd already seen.  Holly has said that's a silly idea and it would make more sense to only buy ones I'd seen and knew were good.  But if I did that I'd buy way too many.  This way I'm forced to evaluate it without seeing it, decide if it's worth the risk of adding to my collection or if I'll hate it.  It also means I see more movies I haven't already.  It puts the brakes on the whole deal.
  

  
But tonight I had to buy movies I'd seen.  While scouring all the shops for our very own Wanzhou copy of H2G2 I came across Star Wars, the good ones.  And I picked them up.
  

  
I just finished watching Luke blow up a Death Star, saw Greedo shoot first (though it's quick enough to ignore and I have the pre-Special Edition versions on VHS for straightening out how the story really goes for anyone who needs it), and read all sorts of new stuff into everything Obi-Wan said (though I haven't seen ROTS yet I read spoilers) and it was great.
  

  
So yeah.  Nobody cares if I broke my little promise for Star Wars.  Just me.  And you could probably weasel a way into saying that because of all Lucas' fucking around I haven't actually seen these movies before, but that's just stupid.  It was a principle that meant something to me. I made an exception.  Selah.  I'm not even feeling too guilty about it.
  

  
And if you think this is taking things a bit too personally just wait till I watch the Empire Strikes Back.
