I hit my wall today. The thing that comes in every goddamned piece of fiction I attempt. The point at which everything becomes stage directions and there's no writing around my dialogue. This always fucking happens and I've never gotten past it before. I was really hoping it wouldn't happen this time that the story was going to pull me along through this shittiness. But it isn't doing its job. So today I quit where I was because I could see how I was trying to get out of my hole, by writing something I've written a dozen times before. Which wasn't helping. It fills pages but doesn't help.

The main problem with this sort of thing is that it draws my attention away from what I'm trying to do, and I think there's something interesting in there. I think it's a story a theme I'll come back o over and over again because of my interests and the people I know and the things I read. It draws my attention into the clicheness of everything and how crappy and boring it all will be to someone who isn't me. And I know I can't think about that; this is just a shitty first draft. It'll be done in six weeks. Then I can type it and make it good. I know this is the plan. I know that what I should do is just write ten pages of dialogue tomorrow. Just people talking. That's not what the story needs right at the very moment but it is what I need. I've got miles to go before I can really justify indulging in a sweeping camera pull back to let my narrator get some room to pontificate. Man, I want to throw this whole draft away right now, but I can't. I need to finish it. It's warm up of a sort for turning the China book into something decent instead of just typo-fixed journals.

Sigh.

I'm currently very interested in procuring a copy of the scroll draft of On the Road, and looking through my shelves I'm shocked to discover I don't own a single normal edition of the book. I guess I've only read it once, and in a library edition at that. No wait, I remember taking it out of the library and reading it, but what branch could that possibly have been? I'm picturing dark metal and concrete surrounding the shelves. Not quite overpowering dankness, but the sense that you were underground despite the lying windows. Was it Centennial library? What did the place look like before becoming the well-lit Millenial place it is today?

Gah! Now my Y key has snapped right off my keyboard! All I have is a little nipply thing that needs much more deliberate pressing to get anything to show up on screen. This could end up being very bad for my typing output. Although how often do I really use a Y? Many many times. (11 in this paragraph alone, though that's probably a bit skewed due the what I was discussing. 12 now.)
