48
  

  
The tattoo guy had a doctor's appointment that took all fucking afternoon, so I'm sitting here without ink permanently a part of my skin.  Later tonight, though.
  

  
_The mainstream, in comics, means superhero books. That's something that needs to change. There's no special dispensation for comics that means that here "mainstream" equals "men in tights wrestling each other in the street" when everywhere else it means pretty much anything BUT men in very tight costumes wrestling each other in the street._ - Warren Ellis
  

  
And I'm reminded of John not wanting to come between two men wrestling in Jared's basement because he is "little and pretty."
