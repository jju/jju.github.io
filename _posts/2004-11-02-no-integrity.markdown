Last night Margie gave a lecture on the US Election that I watched.  I really wanted to ask tough questions when she opened up the floor, since there were a lot of things that she said that I disagreed with.  Especially saying she could think of lots of presidents who were worse than Bush.  But I just lobbed a softball that let her explain absentee ballots.  
  
I'm almost done marking all those midterms.  
  
And more about the Henan riot from the [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/international/asia/31cnd-china.html).
