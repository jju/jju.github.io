So today I finished the short story I was working on and started a new project that's going to be a bit of fun, and won't take too much of my time.  
  
While I wait for Hassie to draw things for the serious/awesome comic we're working on, I decided to make my own comic strip.  Basically it's a writing exercise, another way besides the blog to get my writing muscles warmed up.  
  
I managed to convince Alison to let me use these perfectly panel-sized pictures she had lying around as the base for me to work from.  I scanned 12 of them into the computer.  Now those twelve pictures are going to be the endlessly rearranged and recombined pictures for a three panel comic strip.  The idea is that each day I'll pick three at random and then write a story to go with them.  I don't need to draw anything, just tell stories in about ten lines.  They were designed with this sort of thing in mind, so there's a cast of characters and varying situations and stuff.  
  
Right now I'm working on the mockups and choosing fonts and some of the basic stylistic things.  When it goes live, I'll let you know.  It'll definitely be before our family Christmas, so when the aunts and uncles ask, "What are you doing these days?" I'll have something to explain.  I'm also bringing along a copy of the Geez issue my article will be in.  
  
The other day I saw one of my cousins for the first time since I'd been back and I was sheepish about the whole "I don't have a job" thing.  He told me to just say I was working on a book.  "All you need's a title and you're not a liar."  He seemed to be joking.  
  
It's not that I feel bad about not having a real job (though I sometimes feel bad about not feeling bad  about not having a real job).  It's more that I know Grandma was always very proud that all her grandkids were being somewhat successful.  And now there's me.  "But Grandma, I make cool buildings out of junk to play with!"  She loves me anyway.
