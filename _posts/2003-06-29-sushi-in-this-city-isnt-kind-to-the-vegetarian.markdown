Sushi in this city isn't kind to the vegetarian.  Not that it does bad things to you, it's just not providing you with amazingly wonderful variety.  Sushi Train in Winnipeg is loaded with veggie options, including my favourite, shitake mushroom sushi.  Not here though.  Cucumber rolls are about all I can get.  Sigh.
