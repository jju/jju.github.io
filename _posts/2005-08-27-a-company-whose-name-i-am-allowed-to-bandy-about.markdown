Just tossing this one out there as a reminder of issues I want to talk to some of the farmer kids about.  [Our Reckless Chemical Dependence](http://alternet.org/envirohealth/24644/): 

<blockquote>"Rather than seek out 'less harmful' pesticides, we should be making an agriculture that cuts or ends our need for such chemicals. We should look to organic agriculture and to farming techniques that use more natural systems of pest control. Crop rotations that incorporate greater diversity than just alternating between corn and soybeans are chemical-free ways to control weeds."</blockquote>

I wonder how much [Agricore United](http://www.agricoreunited.com) tries to promote that kind of agriculture.
