[An interesting piece on Alternet](http://alternet.org/election04/19840/) which reminded me of the military training going on around here.  Thousands of people wearing a uniform wouldn't be so scary here, since that's what I'm seeing every day.  Very different context, I know, but still.
  

  
I went downtown today and found it really funny that if I want to buy any clothes that I'd actually feel comfortable wearing here, I have to buy from places like the Gap's Chinese equivalent.  Everything else is fricking golf shirts!  It's impossible for me to explain my hatred for golf shirts and my relief at finding shirts that I could wear without despising myself.  Bet you didn't realize I had such strong feelings about fashion eh?
