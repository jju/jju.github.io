I didn't page at all tonight. Just LSAing at the returns desk mostly. I checked in a lot of books and the time went much more slowly than normal. But it was probably a good thing because my legs are killing me from throwing myself around the frisbee field trying to maim friends and acquaintances on Saturday. I wasn't really up for a lot of squats and such today. Plus I get paid a bunch more to LSA than page I think. A bunch being some number I'm not quite sure of.

Last week though, when I was cleaning up on the fourth floor I found a heap of the following books left behind by the same person:


	
  * 3 or 4 different chess books

	
  * 2 SAS Field Manuals

	
  * A Yoga book

	
  * A Pilates book

	
  * Control Your Drinking

	
  * The Fidel Castro Reader

	
  * Telephone Sales for Dummies
So what was going on in that guy's life? (He wasn't one of the homeless regulars, if that makes a difference.)
