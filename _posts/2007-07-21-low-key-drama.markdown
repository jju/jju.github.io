Yesterday I finally got the appropriate response to my cleaning up the library question.  The last hour of every shift at the library is spent picking up all the books that patrons have strewn about the library.  It's a big building and people are messy so this goes on for a while.  But there's always someone who has a huge stack of books around them when time is running down.  I circle a bit, keeping an eye on the stck to see if any of them are being used.  If they are I don't try cleaning them up.  But even when I do get there I always ask, "Can I take these?"  And everyone always says, "No they're not mine" or just "No" while they push the books towards me.  They never answer the question I ask, always thinking I'm asking "Are you going to be an asshole and hang onto those books for forever?"  I admit that sometimes I ask "Are you done with these?" in which case the "They're not mine" answer works.  And now that I think of it that's how it played out yesterday.  So that's not too exciting.  Sorry.  
  
The other day there was a guy with a prosthetic leg at the library.  He was up on the fourth floor with his son, probably in his mid thirties or something.  His voice was vaguely raspy.  Wore a baseball hat.  And had his leg lay discarded on the floor, while he was kicking back with his stump up on the table.  
  
I went to the Fringe Festival last night and saw Kafka & Son, a one-man play based on a letter Franz Kafka wrote to his father.  It was really well done.  Crow feathers everywhere, and very few laughs, but it worked really well.  In general, I like seeing material that's written by someone long dead at these things.  I get a better sense of how good the actor is than if I'm trying to figure out what's the fault of poor writing.  Then later we saw Alix Sobler Slept With my Brother (by the guy who did Confessions of a Repressed Mennonite) which was much funnier.  And included the worst (in a dramatically appropriate fashion) version of Wave of Mutilation I've ever heard.  It was pretty great.
