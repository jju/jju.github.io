That works out to 5 more weeks (for all us mathematically challenged arts grads out there).  I start getting shots tomorrow, and am hoping they take VISA for the shots, because what with the trip to BC and the 2nd Edition of [Unknown Armies](http://www.unknown-armies.com) being released, I am down to $40 after paying for the session where they tell you which shots you're going to need.  And though I'd get paid in two days, my boss is in southern Ontario, so I think my cheque'll only be available to be cashed on Monday.I played D&D for the first time in months last night.  It's a new character for a new campaign, and I had a really good time.  Though the campaign is going to be put on hold for two weeks while Chris goes out west, which means we're going to have to cram in a bunch of sessions before I leave.  It's funny, but this game is the thing that I'm feeling bad about missing by going away.  I think it's just because while I might miss out on doing stuff with my friends, there's nothing "plot significant" that goes on at the Cambridge or whatever.  Sure, there'll be good stories, but those can be just as good to hear as they are to experience.  Whereas the game is many "plot significant" events that're going to go on without me being a part of, and aren't nearly as cool to hear recounted.  I know that once I'm gone if I miss anything it won't be the D&D campaign, but it's just weird how I was thinking about it today.  This sounds all wrong, but whatever.

Dave started learning to play the double bass tonight.  Those Wiebes.  Hanging out with them when they're all doing musicy stuff sometimes makes me wish I had siblings.  That's pretty much the only time though, and it fades pretty quick.
