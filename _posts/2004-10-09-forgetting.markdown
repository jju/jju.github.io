I'm not a big fan of IMDB's plot outline for [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://imdb.com/title/tt0338013/).  But I just watched the movie, finally.  It's one of those movies that I should have seen the first day it hit theatres but didn't.  Just like Adaptation, really.  I don't know why it took me so long to see these movies (well, I do know why for Sunshine, but never mind).  
  
Anyway, I really liked the movie and it's great that my copy of it is a nice good quality affair.  I didn't even have to turn off any Chinese subtitles.  
  
I ate dinner with Alex tonight after not seeing him for a week.  I felt bad cause I completely ditched him yesterday to go out for dinner with my basketball team.  It was the first meal like that I'd been to without Margie around to buffer conversation.  It was all good.  I like drinking with teachers.  We've established that I'm not a real man and so I don't have to down my glass every time anyone proposes a toast, but I do it often enough that they don't think I'm some sort of mud stuck stick.
