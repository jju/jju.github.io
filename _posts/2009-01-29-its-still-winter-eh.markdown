I have another book review to do I think, but first, a computer review. Because I have a new one! After much complaining and runaround I finally ended up with a 20" iMac loaded up with as much RAM as it can hold. It is a very pretty machine and I'm super pumped to have a tool I don't have to yell at for lagging behind my needs. No longer will looking at photos be a laborious grinding ordeal. It can rip CDs and burn new ones. And DVDs. It's bigger than my TV so my office may be where I watch my stories when I'm alone. And I actually get Twitter now. Now that I can have it tweeting to me like a running conversation instead of something I have to go find and search through it becomes much more interesting. Note that this was a piss poor review of the computer.

Other news: First Storytime of the season (I kept on calling them semesters at work today)! Almost all the kids I thought would be there were. Nobody freaked out that their parents weren't in there with them. My felt story version of The Mitten ended in a big "Kablooey!" I hadn't practiced, but worked really well. One of the kids asked if we were reading about a dragon today (I keep the potential books up on a table behind me while I'm reading to get feedback of what might be their favourites and such) because he saw Derek the Knitting Dinosaur. We didn't get to it but next week is Demanding Dinosaurs, so I know what the first one is going to be.
