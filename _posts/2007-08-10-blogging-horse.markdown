My shirt from the Indyish Assembly thing arrived this morning, throwing into stark relief that I haven't worked in a week.  I mean, I've been at the library earning my nickels, and prepping stuff for games, but none of my writing projects have had any progress since I went to the CMU library to borrow English translations of Russian colony journals.  I guess I've changed a couple of things with 3dWorlder, having cut the projected length in half.  
  
There are new pages at the library and hopefully I will be something else some time soon.  
  
Also, I don't know what's wrong with the two previous occupants of the room I've moved into.  They were unable to make it look comfortable or livable.  Walls bed computer arranged like some antiseptic flophouse is all I've seen in there previously.  While it's a mess right now, my version of this room is very nice.  Cozy.  
  
I got Issue 1 of Warren Ellis' Doktor Sleepless yesterday.  It looks like it'll be good, but I can completely wait for the trades.  Same goes for Black Summer, which I got last week.  Buying comics is fun when they're cheap.  And aren't filled with ads.
