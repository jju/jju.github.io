The wedding went fine and people had fun. Hooray and congratulations. [Pictures are up on flickr.](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/sets/72157614214380129/) And yes they're a little grainier than I might have preferred, but I accidentally bumped my ISO up to 200 which my camera's little sensor doesn't like too much. I was very busy (and wasn't the official photographer anyway) so I didn't take any really neat pictures. Sorry. (I do like [this one of Sri](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/3299737149/) though.)

It seems that all the work of carefully picking songs was fairly pointless for that crowd. Note for the future: all Mom's family ever wants to hear is Johnny Cash or something you can two-step to. Ever. Seriously, future self, why are you even thinking about playing anygoddamnedthing else? You are truly a fool. Ahem. So I'm glad I did end up bringing the laptop instead of just running off iPods as it was much easier to change things on the fly. [People danced](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/3299783133/), which made my mom happy. (Although when I started picking music weeks ago she specifically said "Oh no, it's not a dance; it's a house party!" so what I had was mostly along those lines.)
