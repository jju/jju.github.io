[What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](http://www.amazon.ca/What-Talk-About-When-Running/dp/0385666276/) is Haruki Murakami's latest English book. Translated from the Japanese I mean. He doesn't write books in English. It's a memoir about running. I don't run, and probably won't take up the sport just because of this book. But I do write a bit sort of, and I enjoyed the book most when he talked about the issues in long distance running as they apply to writing. Mostly though I just like the Murakami voice and would read anything written in it. I wonder what his translations of English stories read like in Japanese.
