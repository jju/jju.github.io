So if you were in charge of procuring a bed for a single, non-horribly deformed, 25-year-old male's apartment, how big a bed would you get for him?  And more importantly, what does it say about your opinion of his chances with the ladies when the bed you get him is about as wide as his laptop?  
  
Possibly (to put a slightly nicer to his fragile ego spin on it) the bed is to put one small roadblock in the way of him getting amorous with students, who would otherwise be flocking to his boudoir.  Possibly the school knows of [organization redacted]'s policy on bomchikkawowow activities when the partners are not legally bonded and is merely supporting that.  
  
I'm sure the thought process was innocently "Why would Justin need more space?"  And truth be told, I don't.  But it would have been nice for them to maintain some sort of facade that my bed won't always be cold and lonely.
