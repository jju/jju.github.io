Hmm, what has happened in the last week? I got two of my shelves, but there was an accident in Sean's garage which means the other two need to be repaired before they can get here. So I am still surrounded by boxes in a very unfinished room. Hopefully the shelves'll be in and the boxes'll be out before the snow and the real cold start. Part of my plan with these shelves is to have them be an insulating force on my library's exterior wall.

I haven't had the heat on so far. A couple of days around the end of September I needed it in the living room, but for now I'm using blankets and dressing warm and taking hot showers. It feels a lot like China. Which is kind of nice sometimes.

I went for lunch with my mom today and while she was trying to figure out my schedule I just gave her my phone and said "The green dots are when I work." There are a lot of green dots in October. It's going to be a while before I start to see any of the money all these green dots represent, but when it happens I'll be able to ... not really do anything different than I have been. I've been flirting with the idea of buying a new computer, but $2000 is still a lot of money, and I've got bills to pay and it all sounds so horrible when I say those words. Once I start getting paycheques again (the trip to Amerrica has precluded any income for almost a month now) I'll be able to see how much those bills eat up of my money. See how much it's actually possible for me to save. I've got places to go and airline tickets to buy.

I read Mona Lisa Overdrive yesterday. Finished it, I suppose. I do like William Gibson. Even his 20 year old visions of the future of cyberspace that don't quite work any more. Do people get mad that their SF isn't actually telling the future? I worry about that in my writing, that everyone who might read it will say well obviously he didn't think at all about how life would really be. Because no I don't.

On Monday I spent a laborious day on the computer (Laborious in the mental/spiritual sense because the PowerBook's fan is so loud when it has to work I want to smash the thing to bits, but I can't because of paragraph #3 above. The fighting between the part of me that wants to stay sitting at the keys working and the part that wants to get far far away from the whining drone of a poorly built aircraft beneath the keys takes a lot of energy. The main reason I want a new computer is to have one that'll be quiet and let me get on with the normal writerly internal conflicts.) and finished something that isn't the new draft of 3dWorlder. I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out I think, but I'll find out for sure in a few weeks.

Tonight I've got another storytime. The theme is All Grown Up. I figured out my order of stories last night in my second shift of the day. I did a split shift at Intrepid and while it wasn't the most horrible thing in the world I think I can get by without them becoming a regular part of my schedule for now. In between shifts I walked as far north on Keewatin as you can walk. I came to a housing development a few hundred metres from what looked like the edge of the city. A check of Google Maps tells me what I thought was the Perimeter was only Jefferson. I was still a couple of kilometres from the country. Oh well.
