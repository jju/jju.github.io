Knowing how Iain M. Banks' Culture novels would be made me more comfortable with [Look to Windward](http://www.amazon.ca/Look-Windward-Iain-Banks/dp/1841490598/). This time I had no expectations it was going to veer off into a Vernor Vinge type thing and was ready for its Alastair Reynolds similarities (avec more literary heft). I was ready for the decadent Culture to just kind of go along and for the plot to be not unimportant but like a red-herring for the dilemmas going on within characters. There was a secondary character/plot that ended up being close to a pointless (beautiful) digression about megafauna but it capped off the end of the book wonderfully. 

I want to be a spaceship when I grow up.
