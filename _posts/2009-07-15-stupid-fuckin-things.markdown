As you may have heard my bike was stolen. From the locker in the basement of my fucking building. The door was locked but the thief appears to have pulled the plywood door off the hinges, bypassing the lock all together. It was a good bike. I spent a pile of money on it however many years ago it was. Probably 10. 

I'm not as mad about it as I feel I could be though. It's just another thing to add to the list of why I made a horrible choice last year in buying a place of my own. It feels right and proper to be punished for my stupid fucking greed, for wanting to own a place to hold my books and cat. Remember how I didn't like being congratulated for buying this place? Someday if I am ever able to sell it you can congratulate me then.
