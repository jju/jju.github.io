I kind of wanted to bike to school today, but didn't because I couldn't find my red flashing light. There isn't  very much of me that wants to be riding around in the dark without something telling vehicles not to hit my fragile little body. Now I've got that sorted so tomorrow I shall set out to regain my fitness. Be prepared for a couple of weeks of me complaining mightily about this city's stupid hills.

Classes began today and I think this Children's Literature course will be good. And I know more people than I'd expected to be in the Management class. As it stands right now, since I have to take a course and a bit in the summer anyway, my data visualization class which starts tomorrow is a provisional class. It'd be some interesting stuff, but I'm interested in a bunch of the summer offerings so dropping it wouldn't be too terrible.
