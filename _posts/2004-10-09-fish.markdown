I went walking downtown today for something to do to procrastinate from working on a story and outside a shop were these fish.  It wasn't a pet shop but a fishing shop.  I think that explains the look of fright in the one on the left.  
  
I'm also testing some of flickr's extra features with this post.  Hope it works.
