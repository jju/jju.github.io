My mom won a sweet sweet bike the other day at her office Xmas party.  It's blue and shiny and is like the Harley (or possibly Vincent Black Shadow) of bicycles.  I had to ride it to my house from her office last night, because it was too much of a bicycle to be carried around in the back of a truck made of Lego.  It fought and rebelled and forced me to swear at it a lot.  If you come to the party at my house tonight, you will see this bicycle.  I have a bucket ready to collect your drool.  
  
Speaking of which, there's a party at our house tonight.  Rachael won't be there, if that's a drawing point, and frankly, I can't see why it wouldn't be.
