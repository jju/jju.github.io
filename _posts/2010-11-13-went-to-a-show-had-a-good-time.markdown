The Dan Mangan show last night was pretty good, but my favourite part was [The Burning Hell](http://www.myspace.com/mathiaskom). They were awesome. Ukulele, cello and assorted electronics with songs about death. They were exactly my cup of tea. The kind of people Steve would make sure I went to their show if they were coming through town. They're going to be in Winnipeg at the Park Theatre on November 19, 2010. If you're there, I'd give them a listen.

I felt like Mangan and his band were out of sync most of the time, but maybe I was just let down a bit from the awesomeness beforehand. And the fact that I knew all the songs that everybody knew. Afterwards Marlis was wondering if the girl running down to the front from the seats was a plant, because she sure opened the floodgates for all the kids to rush to the front.

Today I biked to school for a meeting then biked home and finished the big website homework assignment that had been eating up my time. Tonight I relax, then tomorrow I get seriously to work on the next one, which isn't a website. Not that this was a useless assignment. My CSS is better now, and it was a good excuse to try using Vim, which went well.
