2 purchases and all my DVDs are a part of the web!  I had a breakthrough this evening and found that I will not have to go with (shudder) the Bourne Identity to tie Croupier and Run Lola Run in.  Instead, I can get Gangster No. 1 to pull in Croupier (GN1&C share a coproducer, GN1& the Big Lebowski share Daniel Thewlis), and Storytelling (a movie I've wanted to see since seeing a trailer at cinematheque) has both Franka Potente and John Goodman, who's all over my web.  So satisfying.
