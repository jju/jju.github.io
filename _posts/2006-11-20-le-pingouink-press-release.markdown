Okay, so there hasn't been any blogging for a couple of days.  I apologize for nothing.  Though I do have sort of an excuse.  My new webcomic is live.  There's a link up in the menu bar next to the snail, entitled _le pingouink_.  That's it.  Here's the press release.  (If you want to cut to the chase, [here's the comic](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/).)  
  
Have you been suffering from a dearth of penguin-related French tragedies?  Admit it, we all have.  I mean, sure there's penguin-related comedy, documentaries and even Ukrainian penguin crime dramas, but stories of a love-lorn French penguin, trapped in a situation he did not create?  I haven't seen many around.  (And please, don't tell me about them if they do exist.)  Until now.  
  
[_le pingouink_ (Now in English)](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/) is just such a story, in comic strip form.  
  
The backstory: In France circa 1987 the comics world was swept by an imaginary-French hit pronounced Le Ping-Goo-Wink (yes, that's how it was pronounced, even in France).  The simple tale of a penguin and the humans he lived with.  What turned the penguin family drama genre on its head was its simple palette.  All the previous penguin family dramas had been built on elaborate art, intricate yet sweeping plots, and a strictly defined set of biological rules based on then-current penguinological studies.    
  
_le pingouink_ threw all that away by using 12 fantastic panels in different combinations over and over again.  The artist released the comics in a guerrilla fashion, never revealing his/her identity (or whether that 'k' in the title was a typo).  In summer 2006, Alison Froese was given (or possibly stole) a box full of old strips and brought them back to Canada, where J Jack Unrau saw them and realized he was looking at a slice of history.  He decided to use his mediocre French skills to digitize and translate them for the English speaking world.   
  
[The real backstory (and this is the only time you'll see it): Justin (J Jack Unrau) can't draw.  Justin wanted to make a comic that would be very little work for his artist collaborator.  Alison had these pictures lying around that were meant to be rearranged to show stories about this family including a penguin.  It was very little work for her to allow Justin to scan them and type on them.  The deal is this:  Every weekday Justin randomly picks three panels and writes the story/philosophical musings that must go with them.  It's sort of like the [Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com) idea, but with a bit more visual variation (and fewer dinosaurs).]  
  
So yeah, the comic is at [www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/series.php).  If you live your internet experience solely through an RSS reader or Bloglines here's [the feed for that](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/rss.php?type=creator&creator=1550).  Alison and I hope you enjoy it.
