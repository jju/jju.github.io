Not very pleasant: Taking the sheets off your bed to do laundry and discovering a nest of spiders between the bottom sheet and the mattress!  My situation was less unpleasant because there was only one spider.  And it was small.  But really.  Eewww!
  

  
Much more pleasant: Trapping a giant flying beetle between your bathroom's makeshift curtain and window, killing it, and then with one mighty puff blowing the carcass off the windowsill in a neat little bankshot into the toilet.
