The best part of Nanchong is Beihu park.  I can't even count the number of times I went walking around or sitting in this lake filled bit of niceness this weekend.  
  
I'll just post this picture now and tell the story of impromptu concerts and dancing and such later, cause I have an actual deadline I'm working to for the next couple of days, and want to do the erhus in beihu justice.  
  
There are a few more pictures up on Flickr too.
