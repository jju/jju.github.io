Today I received my Chinese copy of Anansi Boys which was signed by Neil Gaiman. Thanks so much Todd! I am shocked by how large the page numbers in the book are.

At work today the South Asian guy who reads out loud was on the fourth floor while I was cleaning up. The only bit I caught clearly (though he'd been going on about the difference between Indian and Aboriginal for a while) was "I live in an Indian Ocean. On Zanzibar island."

I truly wonder how many people with less seniority than our not-quite-retarded page will end up quitting. If he were ahead of me for getting shifts and promotions there's no way I could carry on. And he's very aware of his rank which makes him all the more infuriating. He can't do several parts of his job but he's very concerned that he appear to be doing something.

It was funny today because it was just him and Judy on the fourth floor (nonfiction, the big one) for about half of clean up. And he is useless. When I wandered up after finishing the second floor (cleaning up Biographies and DVDs goes pretty quick) Judy was very glad to see she didn't have to cover the entire floor on her own. Okay, that's not especially funny, but listening to him complain to Judy that Soraya and I were up there cleaning up the section she'd told him to work on was. He's been there how many months and is worrying about whether he'll get fired before he can get his pension if someone complains he's not doing his job.

It's a good thing I've had training in not being an asshole anymore, because the City of Winnipeg has strict guidelines on what constitutes harassment/creating a hostile work environment. People who know me well could probably tell exactly how quickly I'd be fired for opening my mouth sometimes.

Speaking of not opening my mouth, the other night at the Cavern I ended up hanging out with Romi Mayes for a bit because Neville had come over to say hi and then she'd come over and then Neville left and Dawson arrived and she introduced me to Dawson with the comment that I "hadn't said four words" but that I was Justin. Later on when she left and it was me and Dawson he asked if I was a musician too and I felt really bad for not being one. They'd been talking about being on the road and touring and all this talk that I would have loved to be a part of, but that's all stuff I can only listen to. Sometimes pop in an anecdote about my friends who are musicians.

I'm not sure I like how I don't have anything to talk about apart from the things I read on BoingBoing each day. I don't want to be one of those people who just spouts off about what I saw on the Colbert in an attempt to leech some of the talented people's coolness into me. It's ridiculously difficult to talk about books with people if they haven't read what you're reading. Well, it's not difficult but I find I sound like a pompous ass without any real insight beyond "I really like it." I wish more people cared about baseball so I could have that as a topic. I wish a lot of things.
