Four day weekends are excellent.  You should have one sometime.  
  
I went to Nanchong and enjoyed an excellent weathered Thursday afternoon up a small Daoist mountain (complete with hermit caves).  Holly and I and this American doctor couple who'd been at Holly's university for three weeks took a chairlift up and back.  The husband of the doctors was a birder.  A birder who talks a lot about birds.  
  
We spent the evening trying to avoid making extensive plans by asking everyone we could find where we should go.  Eventually we were forced to make choices and decided to enjoy a sure-to-be-just-as-beautiful-as-Thursday-was Friday at a nearby lake where there are Happy Farmer Homes and boats and whatever.  
  
Friday started off cloudy and with very wet sidewalks.  We told ourselves that people'd been up early washing the streets.  At the bus station I tried to buy tickets to the county where the farmers are happy next to the lakes but I got a lot of "mei you"s (which means "not have") from the ticket counters.  This seemed odd so Holly asked another bus station person about them because her Chinese is way better than mine.  Still mei you.  Then we thought it might be an accent thing so we showed people the characters.  Mei you.  So we cut bait and tried going to an orchard.  
  
We did eventually get up the hill to the orchard.  It just took a lot of walking through fields (of canola!), past big vehicle driver training, into ditches, across morbidly crusty indigo rivers and along [desolate highways](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/6431348/).  
  
The rainy outdoor tea house on the top of the hill was packed full of people.  At least three.  We warmed up and didn't dry out before heading down to the bus that wasn't many muddy fields away.  We spent the evening watching DVDs with Dan, including The Big Lebowski and having homemade boiled milk Oreo milkshakes.  Good times.  
  
I wandered around a lot on Saturday.  My first trip was to find the good DVD shop, but I couldn't so I used Korean sticky buns to bribe Holly to come help me.  Later we had dinner with some of the other teachers in town and then walked a hundred miles around the city.  There was a sidewalk that went under a bridge, but at an awkward point so we had to duck to get through.  Moments later we met a car zipping along that sidewalk and under the bridge.  I'd expected a good crunch or at least sparks, but was rewarded with neither.  
  
I slept in this morning and spent most of the day on the bus.  I learned that all those mei yous we got at the bus station were lies because there were in fact many buses going to Yuechi.  I don't know what we did wrong.  
  
Anyway, if you have a four day weekend you're looking to spend in a relaxed low-key kind of way, I recommend going to Nanchong.
