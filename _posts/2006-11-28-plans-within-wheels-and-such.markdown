I really enjoy doing [le pingouink (Now in English)](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/).  It makes my days actually feel productive.  I get at least that one thing done each weekday.  Of course, since I do it every day it rapidly becomes less impressive.  When my mom calls to ask what I've done today saying "I put together a comic!" doesn't impress her.  It's like going to work.  Without being paid.    
  
But that might come eventually.  They say you need at least 1000 regular readers before you should start thinking about producing merchandise.  Right now I get 60 pageviews a day.  So if you have 940 friends who'd like it, introduce them to our comic strip.  I wouldn't complain.  Among other things, Alison's very good at making shirts.  I'll start doing real promotion work in January, once there's an archive people can trawl through.
