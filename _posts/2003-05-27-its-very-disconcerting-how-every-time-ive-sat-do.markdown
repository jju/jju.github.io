It's very disconcerting how every time I've sat down at this blogging tool I've been drawing a blank, even though there was a specific thing that I came up here to do.  And I now have no idea what it was.  
  

  
Interesting fact: In the Northwest Territories employers are allowed to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation.  "You fuck women?  Then you aren't working in this steel mill!"  And the poor little straight Inuit boy ('cause there's only one gay Eskimo, but gobs of gay Inuit) cannot do anything about it.  So he gets really drunk on smashed up puffins.  And both Alberta and BC allow employment discrimination based on national or ethnic origin, but not race/colour.
  

  
We had an ultimate practice yesterday because our coach (who blew out her knee on Saturday) doesn't want us to suck so horribly that we're badly demoralized in our first game on Thursday.  We learned about stacking.  And that one of our very enthusiastic players is non existent on defence.  In our scrimmage, I got a point and an assist.  And was far too proud of myself.  Can't throw forehand very well though.
  

  
I'm looking more and more forward to Sean and Reyn coming out.  It'll be a good week, 'cause this week I've got a presentation on Wednesday, a workshop on Wednesday, an ultimate game on Thursday, and a paper due Friday.  And I only have $30 left which I have to pay a $70 cable/internet bill out of.  So I wouldn't have been much fun.  Not that I'm much fun anyways, but at least I'll be able to do stuff.  Like drive around in the bog.  The X is camouflaged right?  Has a good Die Another Day stealth system?  'Cause it seems the bog is more like Assiniboine Forest than the Floodway in terms of people getting mad at people driving their SUVs through it.
