I talked to Sean this afternoon, but I don't know who he contacted, so I apologize if anyone's heard this more than once.  My grandparents on my dad's side died last night in a house fire.  Their house.  Their ugly sonofabitch 50 year old house with shitty ass wiring and wood burning stove burned to the ground.  Well, below the ground actually.  It's all basement now.  So I was out at the farm all day today and will be going out again tomorrow and spending the night.  That need to vomit from last night has just been building, but not really changed, which is kind of weird I think, but whatever.  Everybody has gobs of sudden violent stupid deaths in their family, right?  This is people # 3&4 (incident #3) in my twenty two years.  Not including cancer/heart disease deaths that give you a chance to say goodbye.  By my guesswork Steve's still up on me, but his family deathrate seems to have been slowing down in the last few years.  Go Team Unrau Squared!
