Yesterday I picked up my book that I'm taking to BC (Libra by Don DeLillo) along with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.  Woweewow.  Warren Ellis is right; I shouldn't have left the twentieth century without having read this comic.  Batman's old and retired but comes back to be hunted by the new Commissioner for such crimes as endangering a child (ie. Robin), while the baddies are being released from Arkham Home for the Emotionally Disturbed (see? it's funny!), the Boy Wonder's a girl, the Batmobile's a tank, and it all climaxes with a Batman vs Superman showdown on the streetcorner where Wayne's parents were killed.  Oh boy.  I read it all once through last night and have gone through the Batman Superman fight twice tonight.  It's funny how much I like Batman considering he's such a vengeance oriented fascist.  But really, who could possibly cheer for the red yellow and blue?
