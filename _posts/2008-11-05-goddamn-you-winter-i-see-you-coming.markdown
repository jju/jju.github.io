I have a new job! Actually it's practically the same job, but with two fewer hours scheduled each week. But it's a permanent position instead of the temporary maternity-leave filling my job is right now. This is significant because if somehow I'd gotten to July without getting another job and Nadine decided to come back I'd be bounced back to being a page. Which would suck. 

It'll be a few weeks until I find out if I get the Special Services job which actually would be different and closer to home. A few weeks of weather not as nice as this past weekend. I am not looking forward to the wind and snow poised to smack me around as I ride to work.

Yesterday I took down the Halloween children's book display and put up a winter one. It just about killed me. All those happy rosy-cheeked children who only have to go outside on beautiful winter days instead of the fucking horrible days that dominate the goddamned fucking season just make me want to puke.
