Today was one of those day's that was either going to blow goats (old slutty goats; herpes would be the least of your problems) or kick every ass it could find and then hang out at the maternity wards waiting for fresh ones.  It wasn't quite the second, but getting there.
  

  
I woke up later than I wanted to if I was going to have all the time I wanted at the Potala Palace.  So I seriously considered staying in bed the rest of the day.  Three feather blankets rock the toast you can make inside them.  But I dragged myself out and went to a third rate temple instead.
  

  
Well.  This temple, Ramoche, was simple and had no prayer wheels, but it had monks chanting and drums beating and butter lamps burning.  I hung out for an hour just listening (and wondering what happens to the monks who are naturally tenors).
  

  
When I left I asked the young English speaking monk who sold me my ticket why there were no prayer wheels.  This led to me being invited into the office to hang out with him for another hour.  His job was to write out prayers in gold ink (actual gold) on red paper for the pilgrims to offer up to Sakyamuni.  He asked questions about English usage and stuff, and I asked about the temple and himself.  (The prayer wheels are on the roof waiting for some renovations to the building.)  When I left he asked if I could come back at 5pm.  I agreed.
  

  
Then I went out walking and found a bunch of people stitching furs together on the banks of a dry river.  There were furs all laid out drying and people scraping things.  It was sweet.
  

  
I also found good graffiti on a wall near the river and spent some time in a cafe drinking chai masala, which made me feel like I was back in Nepal.  When 5 o clock came around I went back to the temple.  Togme, the monk, had a couple of his friend's little cousins there who he's trying to teach English.  So we did some exercises from a workbook, Togme doing the explaining and me doing the pronouncing.  I'll probably go back tomorrow, but I realize how lucky I am to be teaching university students in Wanzhou.
  

  
So yeah.  I'm off to get some supper to fill out this sweet day in Lhasa.
