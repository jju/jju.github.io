My internship at CBC's Content Factory is more than half over.  I was on morning shows across the country this morning asking people about Conrad Black.  One of the questions was "Are Conrad Black's personal assets worth more or less than the GDP of Djibouti?"  Sadly, no one countered with "The city or the country?" in which case my hat would have been devoured.  I'm mixing lots of comedy promos, doing a local arts piece on the museum that's hiding on the fifth floor of the Bay downtown, and working on a piece for DNTO entitled "Can Pope JP2 take on Batman?"

In other news, I got my marks from the fall term the other day and embarked on a riotous rollick of fun.  I got a 30 in Media & Politics.  Per cent.  He didn't deign to mark my paper which was worth 60% of the grade.  Now I have to deal with an insane old coot who is benevolently allowing me (and a few classmates) redemption through rewriting the thing instead of getting kicked out of the program.  But he won't give more than a three word reason for why it wasn't "up to standard" until after the deadline for grade appeals has passed.

(Just for the record, the paper deserves better than a 0%.)
