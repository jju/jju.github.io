[Raw Story - City Workers Vote to Strike](http://www.fims.uwo.ca/radio/newraw/news/Feb262004/Feb262004articles/strike.htm): "London's outside workers could soon be off the job.

CUPE Local 107, the union representing city garbage collectors, road sanders and sewage workers has voted 79 per cent in favour of a walkout to back contract demands."

This story went up yesterday, but I forgot to blog it.  If you go to the [NEWS](http://www.fims.uwo.ca/radio/newraw/news/contents.htm) page you can see what others in my class did this week.  I made the pages look pretty.  I especially like the "Christ 18A" picture.
