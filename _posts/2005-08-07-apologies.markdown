I've been trying to write my [Prairiegrass](http://www.houseofdoc.com) response but it turns out that I can't really write in one hour blocks at the net cafe with the little fat guy next to me moaning tunelessly along with his headphoned music.  So consider it another thing that'll come when I get back to Wanzhou.  
  
I also didn't get to the punk show on Friday night.  Everyone's energy levels just weren't anywhere close to what we'd need to enjoy it.  But last night we did go to a sports bar to watch South Africa beat New Zealand in Tri-Nations rugby action.  I was wearing a borrowed All-Blacks shirt and had a great time cheering and getting the game explained to me.  I'm sure Hassie's many explanations over the years laid a good groundwork for it, but Peter's explanations were the most lucid I've ever heard.  
  
Yesterday I also went to the Forbidden City (saw the Starbucks this time) and to the Chairman Mao Mausoleum for the procession past the preserved founder of the PRC.  He very well could be a wax effigy.  He certainly didn't look lifelike as we looked up his gaping piggish nostrils.  There were people offering bunches of flowers.  Supposedly some of them were very reverential about it, treating the flowers like incense at a temple, but all I saw were little kids tossing plastic-wrapped bouquets on the heap and running back to the line.  He wasn't wrapped in the Chinese flag (5 yellow stars on red) but in the hammer and sickle.  All we could see of him was his artificially pinkened face.  
  
Bloody hell, this fat guy needs a punch in the head.  But this is China so I can't just tell him to shut up.
