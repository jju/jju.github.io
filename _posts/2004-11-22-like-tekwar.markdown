I read a book by the Tom Clancy collective today.  Myrrl buys these things for reading when he's in China and leaves them behind in the [organization deleted] libraries.  I have no idea who actually wrote ruthless.com.  I know Tom Clancy and some guy created it, but that doesn't really explain anything.  There's an acknowledgement page but it doesn't say who is doing the acknowledging.  It uses the Tom Clancy name, but doesn't give you any real information.    
  
Sort of fits in China.
