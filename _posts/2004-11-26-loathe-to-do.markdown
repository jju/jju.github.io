Tomorrow I'm going to Chongqing.  I'll probably come back on Sunday sometime, unless I come up with something wicked awesome to do there.  It comes from years of being a part of Hotel Unrau in Winnipeg, but I have a really hard time staying at someone's place where I am completely doing it so I don't have to pay for a hotel (which is what I'm doing tomorrow).  And my Let's Go book doesn't have any great cheap options in CQ.  That's one of the problems with being off the guidebook track: it's way more expensive if you don't Mennonite your way around.    
  
I fucking hate thinking like that.  All of that.  Everything I just wrote.  Sorry.  I'll go away for the weekend and come back happy.
