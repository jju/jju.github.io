My buddy Steveo is heading to Amsterdam next week.  I want him to go to one of these [communities](http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column112a.html):

<blockquote>There are squats of all sorts in Amsterdam, but most intriguing are the communal art squats where sizable groups of artists and creative associates take over large empty industrial buildings and make them into places where they can live, work, exhibit and perform to their hearts� content. The larger squat communities have established impressive on-site cafes where exhibits, performances and dances are staged and food and drink are served to the residents.</blockquote>

If he can pull himself away from the other attractions that is.
