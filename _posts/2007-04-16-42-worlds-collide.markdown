I always feel a little bad this time of year because the hockey playoffs are going but I'm still excited about baseball.  After I got home from work (Interesting things I noticed at the library: 1. the DDS puts books about hair and makeup right next to the books on how to save/fix your marriage 2. a title for an NFB video: "Elder Abuse is Your Business. What Can You DO About It?" First time reading that I completely parsed it as an entrepreneurial aid.) I cooked dinner and watched baseball (and flipped to the hockey games in the less interesting bits).  
  
I hadn't realized that 42 was retired from all Major League teams in honour of Jackie Robinson.  All these commentators were talking about how that number means so much to sport and to America (in reference to breaking the colour barrier).  I feel like I learned a lot, except how everyone was dancing around the issue of declining African-American participation in the game today.  I wouldn't have pegged the numbers of black players at 8%.  They were talking about how you can't play baseball for free and get good (ie. the highschool-college-pro chain doesn't develop great players the way it does for football and basketball - I'd imagine the same criticism would hold for hockey) as one of many reasons.  I'd never thought of that before.  
  
Anyway, I doubt that Douglas Adams picked Jackie Robinson's number for that reason.  Though it does work as a coming together of two of my favourite things.
