We shot my story today and watching the tape has sunk me right down into a funk.  And not the good "water-into" kind Jesus made.  More like faked funk on a nasty dunk.  It seemed good at the time but now I hate it so much.  Tomorrow we edit it and then I'll be rid of it.  Everything that I saw in my head didn't work on a four hour shoot and I didn't want to be a controlling bitch about the camerawork so I left it to my crew, and I just hate everything I see on the screen.  The stuff for the story we shot yesterday was flawed yes, but I could see what we were trying to do.  This?  Nothing.  I still like making TV but I need more time and more control over what's going on.  Neither of which I'll get in TV news.
