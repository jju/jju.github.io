[Sun After Dark](http://www.amazon.ca/Sun-After-Dark-Flights-Foreign/dp/1400031036/), the Pico Iyer book I'd read before thanks to James and Michelle Stabler-Havener, didn't cause quite the same angst in me that Global Soul did. Primarily because this book was less about some idealized form of human and more about the places he'd been. There are also book reviews in this one wherein he talks about a writer's disorientating effects and the relentless proof he tries to hold onto. And there are stories of Rapa Nui and Angkor Wat and Pol Pot, and these address some of the worries of the traveller being a colonial force (even if brown-skinned). The essay about Tibet makes sense, especially when coupled with the essay about hanging with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala. 

All in all I liked Sun After Dark much more than Global Soul. It felt less polemic and more story oriented. And it made me want to go to Bolivia without making me want to kill myself for not being there right the fuck now. So that's a good thing. I guess.
