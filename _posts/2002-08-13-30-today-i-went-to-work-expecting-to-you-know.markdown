30
  

  
Today I went to work expecting to, you know, work, but my boss wasn't back from his holidays yet.  So I came home and watched 12 Monkeys, then actually finished my resume and bio for a couple of grad school applications.  I hadn't made a resume since August of 1996 when I applied at Campaign, but now it's nice and sexy.  I'm going to print 'em out on nice paper and everything.
  

  
So I got my first shot for the trip on Thursday, and I must say hooray for my timing.  I'm still good for most of the shots I got for India the last time.  I only needed Hepatitis B shots.  I have to pay for my own malaria pills (which I'm going to take, despite the hallucinations [to be accurate I only had one hallucination, and it was with my first pill]), but my mom is going to pay for the cipro that the public health nurse recommended for traveller's diarrhea (and I'll be good for anthrax attacks as well).  And I'm not going to get deathly ill this time, so it'll all be good.  I doubt that Ren would feel responsible enough for my well being to rent me a donkey.
  

  
30 30 30 30 30 30 days!  This is the last twelfth of the month that I will go to bed in my own country on until April.  Teehee!
