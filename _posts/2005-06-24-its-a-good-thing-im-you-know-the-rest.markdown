Have I ever mentioned my favourite blog in the whole of the nets that inter?  Well that blog is also a comic and it's called [Overcompensating](http://www.overcompensating.com).  
  

  
It's about the real things that happen to Jeffrey Rowland in his mansion in a swamp in Oklahoma (soon to be Massachussets where I'm unsure about the living arrangements).  Things like visiting the land of the dead, fighting other webcartoonists over DNA, and bullshittin' about life with Baby and Weedmaster P.
  

  
Anyway, long story short, due to a fundraising sale I now own the original art for [Born on Death Row](http://wigu.com/overcompensating/2005/03/born-on-death-row.html).  Because it was a fundraiser the strips sent out were random, but this one is super awesome.
  

  
Jokes _are_ difficult if you don't want to be a jackass.  How many times have I or other DJS5ers (and assorted hangers on) been stabbed with a fork for a joke that no one finds funny?  Countless.  But the true liver of life and getter of jokes soldiers on in the face of such adversity.  Doctor Hospital knows us well.
  

  
I have also been made the Minister of Precipitation in the Loch Ness Monster Adventure Club.  I'm in charge of the rain and snow, bitches!
