So remember two posts ago when I was talking about how much I wanted that Newsworld thing?  They aren't sending my application to the CBC.  The school could pick five applications from our class and mine was not one of them.  I was sure I'd make it past that.  I was sure I had a good application, that they'd want me to have the opportunity to prove I'd be good at this.  I shouldn't have tempted fate with that last little equivocation in my post.
  

  
So I guess I was relying too much on this thing.  I thought I'd be great, but I won't get the chance to see.  Now I have to start thinking about what the hell I will do when I graduate in May.  All my energy had been towards getting this position.
  

  
Fuck.  Sweet howling fuck.
