I don't know why but I spent a good chunk of the afternoon learning about the 9/11 Truth movement. All these people who dispute the accepted versions of the attacks. Oh no, I do know why. Because I was thinking about Watchmen and the big ol' scheme involved within. Fictional disasters led into real ones and I lost a day in reading. Lost. Like I didn't enjoy it.

But tomorrow I go back to my writing quota on the fiction project. A good solid month on that and I'll have a first draft. I've been off for three weeks because the (completely self-imposed) pressure to produce was getting to me, and David was moving in and it was a bit of a disorganized time. But now things are settled and I'm getting dissatisfied about not producing anything, so back to the notebook I go.
