So the other day I met a new page at the library.  Now, I don't really go out of my way to chat with my coworkers at this job, sort of like back at UofM where I didn't really talk to my classmates.  I suppose the mindset is, "I've got friends I can call and go do stuff with right now and don't have to waste time trying to decipher if I like you or not through tedious smalltalk."  I'm very friendly when people talk to me at work.  Well, friendly enough.  
  
In any case, this new page.  He's the kind of guy I figure Reyn helping in one of his many "assisting people in their lives" kinds of jobs.  He's pretty slow and gets confused by sorting things.  Which is kind of the job, but whatever.  
  
I only bring it up here because it's kind of demoralizing to do the same job a mentally challenged person does (although I was a teacher at the same university as Andrew Eggman so I should be used to it).  No illusions about me actually being smart or anything here.  Just a body that shows up.  
  
Man, I hope I get one of these writing jobs.  I could use an illusion of competence.
