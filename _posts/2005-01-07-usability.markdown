People generally prefer reading dark text on a light background, right?  I'm doing some redesigns around here for the non-bloggish parts of the site and I just want to make sure I'm not utterly daft.  
  
The new design looks really spiffy.  The blog'll stay simple like it is.  Maybe a slight change in colour scheme.  This new stuff is full of pictures.  No Flash, but it looks nice.
