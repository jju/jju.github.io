Have you noticed how I haven't been blogging quite as regularly?  It's not that I've lost the will to point out things I've noticed/done.  It's just that my basement room is quite chilly, and the upstairs is much more comfortable to be in.  While my computer is a laptop, it's an old G4 PowerBook without a WiFi card and its battery has degraded muchly, so it's a production to move this sucker into a place where I can work warmly and plug in.  
  
Yes this cold thing was my complaint all through last winter and the winter before.  I know that my room here is objectively warmer than my apartment in China ever was (except for directly under the heatlamp in my shower/toilet) but the comparison with the other nearby places makes it less comfy.  I have to get into a real lather of work down here before I forget I can't feel my fingers.  
  
My Treo has been saving me by performing admirably in its task as ultraportable typewriter (fuck phone functionality is what I say).  I can type while sitting directly over the hot air ducts? outlets? vents? those grates we have in so very few places in this old house.  It's great for doing _[le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/)_ and sketching out dialogue for the New Gib project (which is slowly proceeding).  The only thing is getting that stuff onto the Mac.  But it works.  
  
Other thing:  If I get the library job, I have my eye on a great shirt to wear to work.  No mom, it's not the one you bought me.  This one would bring the hella awesome.
