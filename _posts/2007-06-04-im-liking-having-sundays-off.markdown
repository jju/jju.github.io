Have you read [White Ninja](http://www.whiteninjacomics.com/comics)?  It's another webcomic that I like muchly.  [Today's installment](http://www.whiteninjacomics.com/comics/story.shtml) was something you should read, because it is entirely possible I will use that as a generic moral of the story in future.  
  
Played some boats yesterday with Sean, introducing Reyn to the whole phenomenon.  And smoked some nargile out on various porches.  And finished a reworked draft of a story.  Now I'm going to go into that story and get it all styled up and submit it where it needs to go.
