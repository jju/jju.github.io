[Nepal says army to escort supplies to beat blockade](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/DEL264868.htm)
  

  


<blockquote>Nepali troops were prepared to escort food shipments to Kathmandu, after Maoist guerrillas failed to respond to a government offer to partially meet their demands for lifting a blockade, officials said on Saturday.
  

  
The armed escort of supplies to the capital was aimed at preventing panic buying during the unprecedented siege, which turned violent for the first time on Friday.</blockquote>
