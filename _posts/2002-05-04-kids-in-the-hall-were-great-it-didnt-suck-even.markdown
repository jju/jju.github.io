Kids in the Hall were great.  It didn't suck even one bit!  In their Simon and Hecubis sketch (the multiple personality one with Ed Ted and Fred) Kevin McDonald blanked completely on Hecubis' name in the the dramatic introduction, which was fabjabulous, because if we wanted to see the sketch done the same old way we'd watch it on our collection of KitH videotapes, but this was live and sassy and awesome.  And the headcrushing man crushed people's heads with his camcorder that was hooked up to the big screen behind him and brought Lorelei (Kevin McDonald) to orgasm with his finger in the same kind of way.  There was a good amount of September 11th humour (letting the American flag stop waving means . . . the terrorists win) and a great bit on school shootings.  Oh, Mybootystan in the Buddy monologue, and bowing not so reverently (to suck cock as he motioned for the people who didn't get it).  Very nice all around.

Other news, because of the stupidly high winds today I was done work at 2:30.  This job is going well so far, though I'm sure I'll burn out sooner than later.  Selah.
