I found this alley by wandering around near the Mong Kok KCR station.  Right near the corner was a stenciled "Let's Support Street Art" and all down the wall of this one building was graffiti.  Good stuff.  Some fading and whatever in the lettering, not just tags.

As you get further down the alley you see that on the other side, sort of under an overpass is where some people have their cardboard shelters.  And their big dogs.

So I didn't get all the way down the alley the first time I went exploring.

The next time I was out in that area (we were looking for a working Slurpee machine at a 7Eleven) I showed the alley to my friend Deb.  We walked in for a while until about the spot where I took this picture.  That was when the dog was out and came up to us.

I could have sworn it had been chained up the last time, but it wasn't barking, so we made nice doggie sounds at it and didn't go any further.

It didn't seem to take much more notice of us and pissed on the wall (too quickly for me to get a picture) while we slowly left the alley.

So then we're on the street out a round the corner, deciding whether to go back or continue the Slurpee quest when the dog came running out of the alley and bit Deb on the thigh.  Not hard, but still.  Then it ran back to its alley.

I kind of felt bad for bringing her out there to get attacked by a mean old dog, but then later on Lantau Island someone else got sort of bit like that and I realized it was Hong Kong leading people into the hound's maw, not me.
