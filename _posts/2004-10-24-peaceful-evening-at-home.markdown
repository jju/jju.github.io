Last night after a quiet day of creating midterms for my British Culture class some students came over.  Aesion was one of them.  I've mentioned him before I'm sure.  He is trying very hard to get into the Party and it looks like it might happen next summer.  We were talking about things and he was asking questions about what I've been doing since we hadn't seen each other for a while.  And he asks about if I like to take pictures.  
  
Now Aesion is a nice guy - I like him a lot better than many other students I hang around with - but  I am not telling the future CPC guy about what an exciting week I had taking pictures.    
  
I explained how I take lots of pictures of things going on around campus, since everything is being fixed up and everyone is working so hard.  He seemed to accept that and conversation turned to me not being let off campus on Tuesday.  The girl who helped me find out why I couldn't leave at the gate is a classmate of Aesion's.  I asked him if he knew what was going on, why I hadn't been allowed to leave.  He said he didn't know.  He didn't see anything.  He was sleeping.  
  
I think that's one of the most interesting parts about being here.  There is so little real information you can trust.  Aesion has been a propaganda cadet or something like that and I was curious how he would spin the incident.  But he didn't.  He just ignored it.  
  
I know so much more about what is going on in the US election than I know about what is happening here in town.  Sometimes I barely feel like I'm not even in China (sort of).  And the news about China is bland good news kinds of things about the economy, or vague threats about Taiwan.  One of these days I'll post about the "quirky news" page in China Daily that I am sure is all completely made up.
