No more school!  No more books!  No more students' dirty looks!
  

  
I'm done being a teacher for a couple of months.  Yes, I have exams to mark, but it's not like that really matters.  Even if they fail, the students'll pass eventually so I am in the clear till next semester.
  

  
Now I can fulfil my purpose of making bird flu immune to human antivirals since [the Chinese government says](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/21/content_3116230.htm) they aren't doing it.  
  

  
Or is my purpose to be a drifting vagabond with a harmonica a pen and a camera?  
  

  
Or maybe I should just succumb to my destiny and be a gay slut without family values since that's what us kids without dads turn into, sayeth the Lord via southern Manitoba.  Or so I hear.  (Really though, why would someone say that to my mom?  And how restrained is my mom not to kick said someone in the teeth?)
  

  
I tend to agree with [Caroline](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com/2005/06/i-have-been-thinking-lot-lately-about.html) on these sorts of issues.
