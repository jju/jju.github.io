Just finished watching the Rockets force a game 7 against the Mavs.  The funny thing is that the fourth quarter of the game was preempted by the World Table Tennis Championship.  
  

  
I was pissed off, because it was a 1 point game and the ping pong hadn't even started yet; it was two nerds in suits sitting at a table.  But they seemed to realize the problem, because the host kept saying NBA in an effort to reassure all the Rockets fans that they'd be kept up to date.  
  

  
After a little while they did a picture-in-picture thing of the basketball game.  They kept on shutting it off whenever the replays were happening, and it was too small for me to watch the players' expressions (Nowitzki always looks pissed off), but I did get to see it.  
  

  
I like the basketball at 10 in the morning thing.   Especially when it gives me something to do instead of marking the reading midterms (and despairing over how badly my freshmen did).
