I completely forgot to mention that Alex is back in town for a month.  This is Alex, the tourism student who I hung out with and didn't like very much last semester.  He's off working for an import/export company near Hangzhou (Shaoxing?) but he had to come back to do some final assignments so he can graduate.
  

  
It's sad that he's the closest thing I've got to a Chinese friend* because I still don't like him.  He's snivelly and tries so hard to be impressive it's irksome.  He's making money down there working for some Indian businessmen as their gobetween for negotiations and things.  His boss shouts at him a lot for making stupid business decisions.  And people pay him to bring hard drinking Indian business parties to their restaurants.
  

  
We went out for dinner the other day and quickly ran out of things to say, but then we still had to go out for a beer.  The booths in the bar had big wicker swings for seats, which gave me something to amuse myself with.  Happily, one of his other friends came along and I could leave after one bottle.
  

  
*I suppose Ning Hua sort of counts as a friend but he's way more of a student.  There's Aesion, though.  Forgot about him.  Aesion is more like a friend than Alex.  But it's not like I'd go to Chengdu and enjoy spending a weekend with any of them.
