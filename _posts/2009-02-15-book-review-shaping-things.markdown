I finished reading [Shaping Things](http://www.amazon.ca/Shaping-Things-Bruce-Sterling/dp/0262693267/) by Bruce Sterling today. My review of it today is basically the fact that I finished it. I include less substance than usual (but not much less; I realize these are never more than a couple of impressions) because um well, you know the book I'm working on? Yeah that's going to need to be overhauled intensely because of reading this little manifesto. Many things that were sort of fuzzy are now sharp. So you could think of 3dWorlder as a 70,000 word review of this one.
