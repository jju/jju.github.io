A week from now we'll be at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium waiting for Cake to take the stage.  This is a far easier thing to look forward to than the fruit of my countdown (the format of which I notice has been appropriated without any accreditation since i guess they don't check on the "classy bitch" factor out at oxford).  My Cakewalk disc is now made and I think it's pretty sassy.  I'm drinking tea that I made 10 hours ago and promptly forgot about.  Tasty.
