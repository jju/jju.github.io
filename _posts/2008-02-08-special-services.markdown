Last week (Friday?) I was approached by a woman on the second floor of the library (where the ESL, Large Type, and non-English books are along with the videos). She thought "it would be just the greatest thing" for me to have blue nail polish on just my pinky, like her. "That's what it's all about, blue nail polish and a beard," she said. She wanted to make a video only of people's beards. "Of course then it would be only men, unless some woman wore a Halloween costume." I smiled, was very noncommittal and considered how much I would hate working on that floor full time
