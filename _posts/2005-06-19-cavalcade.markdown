So the Fuling trip was not just a small thing.  The city invited about 50  foreign teachers from all over Chongqing to come and tour a soybean plant.  
  

  
I'm not sure exactly why they thought this would be an exciting thing for teachers to see.  I'm sure it would have been very interesting to a farmer or someone who had ever wondered about how cooking oil is made from soybeans. Me? Not so much.
  

  
It was a nice hotel though and they stuffed us full of food.  Now when I say nice hotel, I mean the rooms looked like a nice hotel anywhere in the world.  That means they are a bit soulless, sure, but it was comfortable as all hell compared to my apartment.  There were two 23rd floors, one that was finished and another that wasn't.  I didn't check out the second 23rd floor at 23:00 to see if ghosts wandered the (very short) hall.  Because I forgot.
  

  
On Saturday we went to a cave in a ten vehicle convoy with police escort.  It was a big deep cave with lots of neat formations (much like the Jeitta gorttoes in Lebanon), but it shared my pet peeve with caves all over the world: the coloured lights.  All the different rocks are beautiful themselves and don't need red or purple or green light to make them better.
  

  
The best part was when the lights went out in the section I was in and everything was lit solely by the walkway lights from the sections before and behind me.  Then it felt like I was in a cave.  What they should do is make the floodlights in a really warm colour and have them be flickering so it's like you're seeing things by torchlight.  That would not infuraite me nearly so much.
  

  
On the non escorted ride back to Wanzhou our driver (of the school's drivers he's the one I trust the least due to some of his previous nonsober driving) kept on driving in the oncoming traffic lane around blind corners.  And then he was passing people on blind corners and meeting cars and all that stuff that you'd probably rather not do on rainy windy mountain roads.  Miss Wang and I both wore seatbelts.
  

  
We stopped in a little town whose specailty is Dou Fu Gan (dried tofu) and Miss Wang and our driver bought a bunch and gave both Margie and me some.  There were dozens of little shops selling nothing but dou fu gan.  Sort of weird.
  

  
So yeah.  Fuling.  Not very exciting.  Though the scenery up the Wulong river is good and gorgey.  Better than the three gorges I'd say, since the river's narrower.
