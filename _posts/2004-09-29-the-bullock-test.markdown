One of the regional stereotypes in China is that Chongqing girls are the most beautiful in all of China.  Something about the hot peppers being good for complexion or something.  I don't know, but I was just in CQ and I am here to report on the veracity of such claims.  
  
Now there are lots of women in Chongqing.  Millions of them.  Obviously some of them are amazingly attractive, but many are not.  But whoever said CQ girls are the hottest must have had some contact with the city's transit system.  
  
Every woman I saw working on a bus (as a driver or a ticket taker) was gorgeous.  Some more than others, but all of them were at least twice as sexy as the hottest bus driver I'd seen anywhere else.  And they don't have to wear uniforms, so there's not that uglifying thing going on.  
  
I'd say that the examination for becoming a CQ bus driver involved the examiner comparing the candidate with Sandra Bullock.  "Yes she drives well, but if I cast her in Speed, would it make more money?"  The male bus drivers seemed to have no such prerequisite.  
  
So there you go.  Unscientific surveys disguising themselves as journalism since - umm - now.
