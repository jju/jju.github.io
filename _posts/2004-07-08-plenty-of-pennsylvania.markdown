I have left for China in a roundabout way that brings me to Pennsylvannia and back to Winnipeg before I go anywhere.  My  orientation has begun in Akron.
  

  
Is it interesting? Not yet.  Are the people who I'm going to China with okay?  They seem so.  From this side of things, we've got me (anthropologizing radio journalist), Phil (west coast chemical engineer), Holly (from Virginia but reminds me of a Winnipegger whose name I can't remember), Deb (ESL teacher for a bunch of years), and Jon and Dawn (plus four kids!).  None of us know any Mandarin which made me feel much better about my pre trip laziness.  Supposedly a lot of teachers don't really get very good and use their students as travelling companions.
  

  
The name of the city I'm going to has changed.  It's the same city, but it is called a couple of things which makes me feel a lot less silly about using the name Wanxian when it's now called Wanzhou.  Interestingly, they're pronounced exactly the same (lie).
  

  
I have a baby in the room across the hall from me in our little (expansive three-wing) sleeping house which sucks because I can't make any noise ever.  Which sucks because I like to listen to music when I blog.
  

  
It's very hot and humid, but we have ceiling fans and such.
  

  
Many males around this orientation have little hair, despite their ages.
