I'm in Beijing and have been eating mediocre Chinese food.  That's what you'd expect, right?  It can't blow your mind on the first day or you'd never have any fun again and all your friends'd just shake their heads and make comments about oral sex and holy figures in the Catholic church.
  

  
Speaking of churches we had a worship service this morning that was less than inspiring but I was wearing a "You haven't had a night until you've had a Mennonite" shirt which made me very happy.
  

  
Classes start tomorrow.
