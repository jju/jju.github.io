Just like there aren't any Tshirts that say "I hurled on the Great Wall" there are no Tshirts that say "I fucked this godawful piece of shit computer that crashed and ate my big long story about hurling on the Great Wall."  Which is, incidentally, one of those Chinese four character poems.  
  
I'll tell the story someday when I upload pictures.
