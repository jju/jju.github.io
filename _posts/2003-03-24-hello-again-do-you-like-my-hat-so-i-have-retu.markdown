So I have returned in a vaguely MacArthurian fashion, though without all the proclamations and I wasn't a scottish guy pulling swords out of rocks either, but hey.   I don't think I'm going to use this as a forum for telling trip stories or anything like that.  Back to the usual randomness.Does anyone know of a really good resource for memetics?  I just read Richard Dawkins' _The Blind Watchmaker_ and it just barely touched on it, but it was enough to intrigue me.

I've become a mac user.  Not a mac evangelist yet, but I understand that that's just a matter of time.  It's a nice and shiny Powerbook.  You see, my mom got a computer last May to replace the one that I bought years before, but it is her computer.  I need one for school and here it is.  Oh, that's right.  In the beginning of May I start my MA in Journalism at University of Western Ontario.  So hooray for leaving Winnipeg (albeit for a smaller and even crappier city, but at least it'll be new to me)!
