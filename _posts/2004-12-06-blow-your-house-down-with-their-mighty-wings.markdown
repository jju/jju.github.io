I got my new [Maclean's](http://macleans.ca) magazine today (along with a package containing more folky music than a stick could be conveniently shaken [or is it "could conveniently be shaken?" Damn you Star Trek for causing so much doubt!] at) and it had a 16 page advertising feature for Holiday Gifts.  I was supremely happy of course and proceeded to buy three of everything for everyone I know.  You know, instead of tearing it out of the magazine in a huff.
