I've been away from school for over a year now.  A summer of manual labour and the 6 months of doing one thing a day, as Reyn can attest to, made for not having to work too damned hard.  Ever since I found out I'd been accepted into this program I'd been gearing up for having to work at something.  I was ready to get thrown off a cliff and fight off the sharks down below before swimming to Cuba and getting an American visa.  Things aren't that tough, yet.  I wanted something immediate and drastic but this program, just like everything else, is incremental.  I want complete resets included in everything, real "and then it all changed" kind of events, except for the things that aren't supposed to ever change.  Permanence and continual renewal side by side.  None of this accumulation shit.  ["What the hell was that about, Justin?"  Just responding to a Big Loud comment on the previous post.  Don't worry. Guys.]
  

  
In other news, you can find out the name and address of any (Ontario) car's owner for a mere $21 using public kiosks for renewing your Ontario driver's license.  Our research methods prof did this with a random car in a mall parking lot on the weekend to see if it worked, and showed us all the information you get for your $21.  So we have a project for when Sean and Ren come in June.
