From [CBC News: Gold giant's plan to move glaciers draws protests](http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/04/15/barrick-glacier050415.html?ref=rss): 

<blockquote>'A glacier isn't a chunk of ice you can just pick up and move,' said Lucio Cuenca. 'It's part of a water basin, and if you move it, you'll disrupt that ecosystem.'  
  
Barrick says its plan won't change the flow of area rivers or otherwise harm the government.</blockquote>
