I'm moved into my new place and it actually feels like it now that the internet is connected. First thing I'm looking at: The [National Parks Service website](http://www.nps.gov), since now that I'm moved (but not fully unpacked) the next exciting thing I'm doing is gallivanting west across the continent towards trees. That'll be on August 30 when I leave, and I'd say I'll be out of internet contact starting then because I'll be off being an outside kid sort of, but evidently campgrounds are littered with WiFi in the 21st century. Hooray for the future. Bringing the inside out and all that jazz.
