I should have devoted my blogging today to the Iranian bloggers who're in prison.  Show some solidarity with my fellow citizen journalists in countries that might not like what they have to say and all that.  But [other people](http://alternet.org/mediaculture/21316/) have far more to say about it.  So yeah.  
  
I've done some fixes so all the HJP pages are this green colour scheme.  There's also a new [Best of the Blog](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/botb.html) page you can get to from the [Journalism](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/journalism.html) page or at the bottom of the archives on the right side of the page.  
  
There's also a PayPal link on the right hand side if you want to donate money to free all those pictures that have disappeared from [my Flickr site](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/).  The free account only allows the last 100 pics to be displayed, but the rest are sitting there just waiting to be looked at again.  I'm just saying.  I promise any donations won't be spent on ale and whores.
