Across the street from 麦缘 (Holly's Bakery) is a gigantic high-rise. In its basement is a vegetable market. On the main floor there's a nice restaurant that hosts a lot of wedding banquets. The second floor houses a vast 网吧 (internet cafe) with hundreds of computers for the medical college students to play games and watch movies on. Above that point it's all apartments, probably fairly expensive ones for Nanchong. 

But on the front of this edifice the most ghetto "Merry Christmas" is scrawled in fake snow. The words are in completely different hands. The "Christmas" trails across glass, slate and brass at an awkward climbing angle. Holly observed it looked like it was sprayed on by their enemies.
