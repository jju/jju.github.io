Okay, this is pretty neat.  The city of Winnipeg is putting their crime stats online.  Which enables me to keep track of how many more crimes occur in [my mom's part of town](http://www.winnipeg.ca/crimestat/d6.stm) compared to [my 'hood](http://www.winnipeg.ca/crimestat/d1.stm).    
  
I learned I should worry about Mom in her crime-ridden district.  So far this year I'm 56 crimes safer.  While most of those differences were because of B&Es and Car Thefts (I guess we don't have as nice cars up here), we only had 6 more robberies, 8 more Sexual Assaults and 1 more murder.
