The problem with the newswires became apparent today.  We were putting together a mock newscast and I wanted something about the WTO protests in Montreal.  There was nothing at all.  Not even a thing saying "Nothing's happening!" which would have been a story.  Bah!  We did get tape from the SARS concert though.  One of the people in our class ditched school for the concert and phoned in a report.  It worked out pretty well.
