My MiniDisc recorder has succumbed to the supposedly infamous "Sharp TOC Writing Error."  Which means that you can record stuff and it looks like it's written to the disc, but when you finalize the recording, it pops up an error message and nothing was actually recorded.  
  
It came up because Ronny (Ning Hua) and Stella and I've been working on creating these PSAs ("Go play sports!") for their radio show.  We recorded them yesterday and today I was going to introduce them to the marvels of multitrack editing.  Twas not to be.  
  
Which I'm not horribly pissed about because it means I don't have anything to do in this gap before marking my exams.  [I love idleness.](http://alternet.org/story/22190/)  That's not sarcastic.  I truly do.  Ask Reyn.  
  
The thing that does suck is having a recorderless MiniDisc.  I've looked all over the intertron and there seems to be no way to fix this error short of mad science (and showing all those fools at the institute).  It kind of fucks any attempts by me to do radio work out here, or collect Uighur folk songs for interested ethnomusicologists on this summer's Xinjiang expedition.  
  
And yes, I do think it's fate getting back at me for not doing any real radio work in the past year.  Now that Caroline's [selling stuff to SLC](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com/2005/06/holy-crap.html) I was feeling bad and hoping I'd be able to find something cool to pitch to DNTO.  And now I can't.  Well, I can, but I have no way to record it, making the whole thing an exercise in futility.  
  
I realize this technological breakdown seems an awfully convenient excuse in light of my comments on Caroline's blog, but it is true.  And I really am pissed off about it.  I didn't actually get on my knees and do a Shatnerian scream, but I did swear a bunch.  
  
I'm sure Ronny and Stella knew all those words before.
