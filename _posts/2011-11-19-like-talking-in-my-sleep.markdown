So apartment hunting in Vancouver from Sydney was something I was kind of dreading. But since Holly decided she's staying in Harrisonburg after Xmas, at least I only needed a place for one person. Last weekend I spent a big pile of time going through Vancouver listings using [PadMapper](http://padmapper.com) and the UBC apartment listings. This is how I met Emma, who has a room in her Coal Harbour apartment (a character building with hardwood floors no less). We exchanged emails and she called one of my references, Marlis.

Now, Marlis is a chatter. An excellent one. Last February when someone stopped in to pick up a wine rack she was selling they talked in the living room for 45 minutes, prompting confusion in the kitchen as to whether this was someone she knew or a stranger. It was a stranger. This served me well, because when Emma called Marlis, they talked for 45 minutes, and Marlis told Emma everything she needed to know about me, so there was practically nothing for us to talk about on Skype the next day. Which, as you may be aware is good, because it's a lot of work for me to be chatty. 

I completely credit Marlis' talking with getting me this place, because really, I'm some strange guy who's going to be sharing space with Emma for months. She needs to have some idea that I'm not creepy or disgusting (which I'm not, but it's much more useful to have third parties confirm that). Thank you Marlis. (If you're in the market for a photographer, check out [Imaging By Marlis](http://www.imagingbymarlis.com/), as she's pretty great at taking pictures as well as talking to people.)
