I saw the Rheostatics play last night.  Before this I'd heard one CD of theirs once kind of a thing, but they were really good.  Way too much soundchecking between songs but hey.  Again, the encore was the best part of the show.  Remember Cake's encore?  I really love an encore that gives you something neat.  The Rheostatics did a version of My Generation, and some other stuff.  Good high energy stuff.  And tonight I am going for sushi.  Good times.
