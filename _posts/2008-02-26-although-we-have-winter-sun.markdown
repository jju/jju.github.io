This week cannot be done fast enough. Soon I'll be gone far far away from [the goddamned snow and the cold](http://www.wetherobots.com/2008/02/21/sad/) to a place with more rain and indoor coatwearing. Twill be a fine tradeoff. I'll miss a bunch of the snowmelt season but will still catch all the gritty brown heaps. But that'll be okay because the baseball season will begin.

At work this week so far I've seen a kid running down the cement stairs on the reading terrace wipe out causing what I imagine would be horrible bruising on his shins, heard a ten year old telling his friend how he dumped a girl "because she lost her virginity to a bent cheeto," and I got a raise in pay. Were those three things connected? Not in the least.
