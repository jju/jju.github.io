I'm in the process of changing my Chinese name.  I've decided I'm not such a fan of An Ping which means something like 'safe and sound.'  I've been looking for something with a bit more connection to me.  
  

  
The family name (An which comes first and is probably the little Chinese language quirk that everyone knows) is fine; it sounds sort of like the beginning of Unrau.  I don't like Ping though.  
  

  
Part of it is because it has a rising tone that is supposed to sound like a question. I hate how it feels in my head like I'm asking people what my name is. 
  

  
Right now I'm thinking hard about Zhu (fourth tone) as my given name.  This means compose/write, and when it's combined with An it's like "calm composition." And it's a more complicated character, and thus more fun to write.  And it's got a falling tone so I can say it with authority.  And it's pronounced like "jew" which is like smushing J & U together, so it fits sort of (plus being called jew makes me laugh).  
  

  
Now to break it to my teacher. . .
