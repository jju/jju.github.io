I [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/hungryj)ed a Wired article on a [Myspace murder](http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.12/murderblog.html) the other day (hmm, that other day appears to have been a mere 11 hours ago) and now I got a chance to read the whole thing.  Good article.    
  
What I love about the internet is how they can do this: [MySpace Murder: The Documents](http://www.wired.com/news/internet/0,72121-0.html).  It's a whole bunch of supplemental material exceedingly relevant to the story that has since been deleted or might otherwise be tricky to find, collected right there.  Great stuff.  
  
Tomorrow morning is my interview with the City.  I'm fully prepared to become a bookstacker.  I'll need every ounce of my multiple degrees to get this job which has a requirement of a Grade 10 education.  
  
Also tomorrow, it's possible that _[le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/)_ won't update as scheduled.  There's some server changeover stuff going on, which means that my finished comics for the rest of the week can't be uploaded yet.  I will get Wednesday's comic up as soon as possible.
