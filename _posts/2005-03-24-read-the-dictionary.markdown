So my good ideas for how to run the class have gotten responses like, "Our old teacher wrote lots of vocabulary on the blackboard.  Things like lists of fruit, or sports.  That was really good."  I would shoot myself in the crotch before spending two fucking hours listing vocabulary that has no connection to anything.  I take refuge in the fact that I'm supposed to be here doing something at least a bit different.
  

  
I also learned that in September there're going to be two families coming to teach here.  This has the possibility of being ridiculous.  That'll mean 6 foreign teachers (and four kids) for our little college.  Somehow I think the banquets'll be a bit different.  And what's everyone going to teach?

I tried posting this yesterday but my internet's been all wonky.  Going to Chongqing tomorrow.
