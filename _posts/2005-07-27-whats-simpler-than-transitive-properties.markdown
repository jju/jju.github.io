Beijing is Beijing.    
  
We're back with [organization deleted]-folk learning Chinese and undergoing workshops and the like.  Last night was a Subway supper then a Starbucks study session.  The studying is actually sort of happening for me this year, which is good, but mildly surprising.  No mom, I won't be coming home fluent no matter how much faith you have in me.  
  
Hmm.  Undergoing is a bit of a misnomer. Yesterday our session on affective learning environments was quite good.  It threw my teaching/workshop leading abilities into sharp relief.  Next Tuesday I'll be doing one on writing good emails home and blogging and such.  I should start figuring out what I'm going to say.  
  
Monday we  went to the Jiaozi Castle for a big group meal.  That isn't the official name, but is the one that fits.  The decor is mindbogglingly easy to label:  It's a medieval European version of a goodtime foodatorium.  The walls are of stone, and have crenellations.  The rafters have sheaves of corn hanging from them.  Papercuttings and Christmas lights hang in the arrowslittish windows.  There's an oversized abacus in place of a moose head wearing sunglasses.  It was the kind of place where you wouldn't want to say it was your birthday because you might get served a suckling big with fireworks (since it's China, we aren't talking about mere sparkler candles) shooting out its ass.  
  
Later this week we're going to the Great Wall.  We'd been promised an overnight stay but that turned out to be absent from the group's agenda.  So after creating a bit of trouble us rabble rousers found a way to make everyone happy.  The plan is for the cool kids to go the night before (Friday) and stay in a little farmer house nearby so we get the starlight and sunrise and no people at all.  Then we'll catch up with the rest of the group for the ride back into the city on Saturday.  Hopefully it'll all work out.
