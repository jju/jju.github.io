The lack of fireworks in Canada is going to be disorienting someday.    
  
It's a perfectly ordinary Tuesday night and up on top of the mountain there's a firestorm going on.  They aren't being shot that high off the ground up there, but because it's the top of the mountain I get a decent view.  
  
They just let them rip in quick succession too, so the show is better than our Canada Day stuff (in Winnipeg at least).  
  
Kites and fireworks are two good things China does to make up for the sky's hideously dull background.
