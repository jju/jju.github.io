I like Tom Robbins books, as I've mentioned here before. Holly read [Villa Incognito](http://www.amazon.ca/Villa-Incognito-Tom-Robbins/dp/0553382195/) and decided I needed to read it. So, while in China, I did. 

It's good but not super amazing. Some great bits though. My favourite:

<blockquote>In the end, perhaps we should just simply imagine a joke; a long joke that's being continually retold in an accent too thick and too strange to ever be completely understood. Life is that joke, my friends. The soul is its punchline.</blockquote>

I wasn't sure if the mythical Tanuki would be a major character in the book, which gave me a bit of preoccupation early on. Otherwise it sprawled and rollicked the way a Tom Robbins novel should. It felt a little like nothing much happened though, like the events were just an excuse to give us the backstory. Regardless, I enjoyed it. It was a good backstory.
