So it's been raining a bit here.  And when I say a bit I mean for two days straight.  Which is awesome except for one thing: the cement around my building is Dial-M-for-ously slippery.  And when you forget that and try to run for a couple of steps because you are trying to return your friend's walkman you wipe out like a sonofabitch.  Like Hermann Maier when he's had a two four of Kokanee and decides he's going to dare to dream.  (The one thing I miss here is people not understanding me because I'm deliberately being clever/obscure/stupid; all my cleverness/obscurity/stupidity is so accidental now.)
  

  
Anyway.
  

  
The Women's Volleyball Gold Medal match was rebroadcast here last night and it was great to watch, even though I already knew how it ended.  I couldn't stand that screaming Russian coach, and wished he'd broken down in tears instead of his poor players.  Bastard.
  

  
I had my first class that I actually felt comfortable in today.  I'm getting myself together in Newspapers and Magazines.  British culture will take more work, especially since I have to get through all the crap of natural resources and history before I get to devote a whole class each to the Beatles and Douglas Adams.  That is when life will become sweet.
