What a day for mail!  My cheque from the Mennonite finally arrived, along with the WiFi card it's paying for.  And I got a letter from Australia!  Is there anything sweeter than a box bursting with good mail?  
  
Maybe it's crossing a street on your bike and hopping up on the boulevard to ride on only your front tire then hopping off again.  I saw a guy do that while I was walking home from buying a screwdriver to open up my computer.  It was very sweet.
