Is there anything more satisfying than taking a bunch of characters who are ready for a big ol' zombie cull and plunging them into surreal weirdness and letting them all go crazy and fight amongst themselves instead?  I can't see how.  I'm not even sorry I skipped out on live karaoke for it.  I never sing anyway.
  

  
I'm also working on the video for my grandma's birthday.  I hate it so much.  But that's how the bills that I don't have get paid with the money I'm not earning.
  

  
Still no word on where in China I'm going.
