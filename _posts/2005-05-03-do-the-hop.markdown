I just watched [The Singing Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314676/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9MXxmYj11fHBuPTB8c291cmNlaWQ9bW96aWxsYS1zZWFyY2h8cT1zaW5naW5nIGRldGVjdGl2ZXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=2;ft=20;fm=1), which is something I'd wanted to do for like a year now.  Much like Dogville this movie was just never in a theatre where I had the chance to see it.
  

  
I liked it.  There were things that I thought were a bit cliched but overall it did not waste my time.  I haven't been watching as many movies here as I do at home, so my standards may be less stringent than they are back there.  Or maybe I'm just enthralled with anything that can divert me from the godawful piece of shit Agatha Christe novel I'm reading (Postern of Fate).  I should have learned my lesson on her and just read The Orient Express or However the Hell Many Little Indians, because those supposedly don't make you want to tear the book into bits and then piss on them as you are reading.
