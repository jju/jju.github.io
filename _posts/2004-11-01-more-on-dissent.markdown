[Ethnic Clashes Result in Martial Law in Rural China ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15032-2004Nov1.html)

<blockquote>The latest unrest followed a clash this summer in a nearby village in which police fired rubber bullets at farmers protesting land seizures and anti-government rioting two weeks ago in the western city of Chongqing. The Henan fighting served as a stark reminder of the varied tensions tearing at this vast nation as it undergoes rapid social and economic change. </blockquote>
