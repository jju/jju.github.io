Okay, some after hours socializing today to kick off the long weekend and people aren't too shabby.  I even told the "difference between your mom and your grandma" joke to one person (albeit after several lubricational drinks [props to Stevie G 'cause I know he wants 'em]) who - hooray! - didn't cringe in disgust.  I haven't tried out the multitalented joke yet.  I don't want all my dreams to be shattered in one fell swoop.  The girl from Winnipeg is pretty cool and we were most likely in the same Literature of War class in 1999.  Fucking Winnipeg.  We have a common acquaintance even before delving into what high schools we went to.  Gaah.
  

  
I do have bars to go to with the guys when they show up in June, including the one across the street from me which has no cover funk night every Wednesday.  Sweetass.
