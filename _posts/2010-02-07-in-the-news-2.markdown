Millennium Library is in the Winnipeg Free Press again, this time for being open too few hours. [Here's the front page story](http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/the-book-on-library-hours-83526347.html) from a few days ago and [here's an editorial](http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/editorials/libraries-are-the-citys-living-rooms-83703827.html). I like how in the first article it says the library "_claims_ to attract 1.5 million visitors a year" (emphasis added) as they just got that number from some administrator. In the editorial it takes that number as fact even though it's not independently verified.

It's also funny how the editorial calls the library the "city's living rooms" and then doesn't mention how many homeless people use the library because they don't have living rooms.
