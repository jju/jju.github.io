Last night I was out walking and stopped for a while to watch the river.  The long river.  That's what it is in Chinese.  Not the Yangtze, but just that big river that's outside.  Like, what other river could you possibly be talking about?

Anyway, it was dark out, because having mountains all around the city means we don't get long lingering sunsets (I shudder to think of how early night's going to falling in December) but like any good sized city, the streetlights were all blazing.  You know that orangey mercury vapour light that replaces darkness in cities everywhere.

But cutting through the city is a big band of real darkness.  The river isn't just long; it's wide here.  Wide enough that the streetlights can't illuminate it.  But you can see the reflections from a few strong lights near the water, and whatever boats are sliding by.

Wanzhou's claim to world history comes in the Wahnsien Incident.  (Have I talked about this city's constantly changing name?)  In 1926 a British gunboat was crippled by guerrilla fighters and then after a long time of wallowing (days, weeks) it escaped.  I hadn't understood how the guerrillas could miss a ship leaving right under their cannons.  Surely they'd have seen it slowly moving from the shore, even if it was dark out.  Now though, after watching that dark gash in the city I can see how it might have gotten away.  Sliding out and leaving its anchor behind.
