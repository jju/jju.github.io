The following is the text of a note I just left on the whiteboard in our kitchen.

<blockquote>Tonight (Feb 2) I had to pee at 10:55pm.  When i went upstairs there was music playing right next to the bathroom!  Needless to say I had great difficulty completing my micturation.  This is the biggest problem humanity has ever faced.  In the future I would appreciate if the house is silent as a tomb when my bladder is full.  The integrity of my kidneys is infinitely more significant than anyone's mere desire to listen to music.

I recorded it here just in case Rachel erases it before Alison gets the chance to see.
