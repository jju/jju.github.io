I forgot, on my walk home from work there was a caravan of people moving furniture (including a 27-32" TV) in shopping carts stolen/borrowed from our local Safeway. They'd traversed Ellice at the crosswalk. As I passed them they were stopping to take a break. I didn't see where the new apartment was.
