Well.  I failed in my five year mission.  I had oodles of time to plan and prepare and "become a journalist so I could go for free" but here I am, sitting in Winnipeg.  While the [Cricket World Cup](http://www.cricinfo.com/worldcup2007/) begins in the West Indies.  I just kept on forgetting it was the most important task I'd set myself back in the day when Reyn and I were briefly cricket fiends.
