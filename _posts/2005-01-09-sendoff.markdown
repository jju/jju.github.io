Last night there was another bunch of yelling and throwing exploding things from the boys dorm.  It didn't go on for as long this time so I didn't get as good video as last time.  But I also didn't get caught taping by security people, so that's good.  
  
My packing is going very well.  It's amazing the space you have in a bag when you've decided you'll be wearing all the warm stuff you own.  
  
Listening to: **16 Shells From A Thirty Ought Six / Rain Dogs / Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet (Live)**   
from the album Tales From The Underground (Bootleg) by [Tom Waits](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Tom Waits%22)
