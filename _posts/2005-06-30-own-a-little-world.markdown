You know what I love even more than the CBC?  When the CBC [interviews Umberto Eco](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/eco.html) about his books.  I can't remember if I wrote about this here or just talked to Holly about it, but reading Eco makes me feel smart.  He tells awesome stories with ideas that would seem really academic, but end up not being so.
  

  
And in the interview he connects directly to me: 

<blockquote>I have the virtue of not listening when people are talking to me, and to muse by myself.</blockquote>

Dude, that's my favourite part about being in China!  
  

  
Today I'd planned to have lunch with one of the English teachers, and it turned into whoever was around the English Department office.  That of course meant that 90% of the conversation was in Chinese.  Which gives the the freedom to just "muse by myself."  I'm not going to have anything to contribute anyway, so why not?  
  

  
Sometimes I try to piece together what people are talking about and pretend they're using the words that I do know.  The resulting mishmash of words I know homonyms for makes no sense but it's fun in a random cut-ups technique kind of way.  In English company I have to keep up with what's actually going on so I don't appear rude.  In Chinese company I can happily appear stupid while having fun in my head.  That's where all the cool kids hang out anyway.
