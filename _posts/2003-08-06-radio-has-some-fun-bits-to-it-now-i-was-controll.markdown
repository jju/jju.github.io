Radio has some fun bits to it now.  I was controlling the boards yesterday for the 4pm and 5pm newscasts.  Tomorrow I'll be reading the 4pm (EDT) news.  If you are bored and want to make fun of me go to the [CHRW webpage](http://chrw.usc.uwo.ca/) and listen to it live using RealAudio (yay!) or MediaPlayer (boo!).  That's 3pm for you Central timezoners.
