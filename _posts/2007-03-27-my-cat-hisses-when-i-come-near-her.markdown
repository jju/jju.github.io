I ordered my new passport today and received my new Driver's Licence in the mail.  Twas a good day for being a cog in the machinings of the world.  Luckily, Hassie was at the passport office at the same time as me so we could while away the hours of waiting by talking about design flaws and Godzilla bukkake.  Good times.  
  
I dropped off my applications for better jobs within the library system and then came home to sleep.  The rest of the day was a complete wash.  Getting up to be somewhere by 8am sucks.  Especially when you also have to take care of two idiot dogs who refuse to leave puddles to quietly contemplate their short existence.  
  
The weather was quite beautiful though.
