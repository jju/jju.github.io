From [AlterNet](http://alternet.org/columnists/story/21384/): 

<blockquote>"Speaking of unsatisfactory allies, Canada has had the nerve (!) to announce it does not want to be under our nuclear shield, if we ever get it built. Gee, how could it not want to buy into (and help pay for) our Star Wars defense system? Just because it doesn't work and costs the earth? Well, they're partly French, you know."</blockquote>

I've got to say that I was glad that Canada said it wouldn't be part of the StarWars thing.  But Canadian companies are still free to bid on the contracts that will come up, which may or may not mean we will profit from putting (nuclear) weapons in space.  And supposedly Canada is still supporting it just by being a part of NORAD, so the refusal more like a domestic propaganda thing to make us feel good about ourselves than anything that'll make a difference.
  

  
But what do I know?  I'm in China.
