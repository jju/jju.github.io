[Journalist: Wikipedia is "outrageous," "repugnant" and "dangerous"](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/28/journalist_wikipedia.html)
  

  
Wikipedia is one of those ideas that I'm amazed actually works.  And then if you read about [The Isuzu Experiment](http://alex.halavais.net/news/index.php?p=794) you have at least a limited amount of proof that it does.  I mean really, why trust the Britannica people (or more obviously, the Encarta people - do they still do encyclopedias on CD ROM?) more than some other random group of people?
