So Jeremy came over this evening and we were shooting the shit for a while until the phone rang.  It turned out that Andrew (J-Dog's dad) had been trying to get their malfunctioning door to close and got it stuck.  Andrew was outside and Lisa (J-Dog's mom) inside.  Could we come help?
  

  
This cut short any video game time, but such is life when there are foreigners and their crazy antics around.
  

  
Jeremy and Andrew and I spent a long time looking at the door and asking Lisa what it looked like on her side.  I used my Chinese to learn their neighbours had phoned for someone to come help and that they were offering Andrew a seat in their apartment instead of on the cold cement stairs.
  

  
The neighbours seemed to think that Lisa had just locked the door and couldn't figure out how to unlock it, but it was jammed up tight.  Lisa had been trying to pry it open with a spoon, which proved too flimsy.  After I passed my Swiss Army knife through their little security flap thing she made short work of the prying and the door popped open.
  

  
But it was still not closing properly (the problem which prompted the slamming and subsequent jamming).  We'd thought it had had something to do with a hole that had been drilled for a network cable.  Possibly the frame had shifted or something.  It turned out that there were two little plastic bits on the top edge of the door that were the problem.  I got rid of them and the door clicked smoothly shut (and smoothly opened again).  
  

  
I was a very banal hero.
