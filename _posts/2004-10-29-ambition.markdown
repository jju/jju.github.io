So I'm now only teaching two classes a week for the next eight weeks.  I think I'll use the time to figure out how the hell to teach.  
  
I gave midterms to my British Culture classes and realized how little of what I'd tried to teach them actually got through.  I feel bad when the administration tells me that my students aren't very smart (or they'd be at a better college is the implication) so I try and treat them like they are smart.  Which fails horribly because they might be smart 19-20 year olds but they don't know what I assume they do.  So my assumptions really have to change, but I don't want to treat them all like 12 year olds.  Frustrating to say the least.  
  
Plus they all cheat.
