So I can't publish my story that I got in court today.  That includes putting it here.  Not that it's tremendously exciting or lascivious.  It's just that I covered a preliminary hearing.  And it might prejudice some juror who read it somewhere for the real trial.  I'd be hunted down and be in contempt of court.

It was my first time being in court though, and a little bit of contempt wouldn't kill it.  In order to walk up to the desks where the Crown and defence sit, people have to do a little bow to the judge.  Icky side of deference.

The other day in print I had to set people straight that those church of god people (who had that big legal battle about hitting their kids with paddles) in Aylmer(?) weren't Mennonites.  Since Mennonites use extension cords.
