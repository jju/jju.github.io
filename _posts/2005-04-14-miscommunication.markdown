I got an email from my mom today.  It included this:

<blockquote>Yesterday I went into our regular Chinese restaurant that is just 1 block from here to get a take out wanton soup.  Yummmm.  Anyway, I was talking to a new worker in there.  She is maybe in her early 20s, is from China and has lived in Canada for one year.  Her English is quite good.  I mentioned to her that I had a son living in China and she wanted to know where.  I told her and she did said she had never ever heard of Chongqing.  I told her it was the Sichaun Province she again looked blank but kept on pushing me.  I told her near the "Three Gorges."  She didn't have a clue.  Then all of a sudden Chonqing rang a bell after I said it about four times.  "It is a very famous place" she said.  Her home town is about 8 hours out of Beijing.  
  
Are they really ignorant of their own country or do you think it was just a communication problem?</blockquote>

As I said in my email back to her, it's a communication thing.    
  
Todd (MEd) told us a story how he came back to school one fall and some students that he knew asked him where he'd been that summer. He said he'd been to Beijing.  Blank stares.  "You know, Beijing" he said.  "Is that in Canada?"    
  
No matter how we think we pronounce things correctly we don't.  It's like how my students have to say "Ranrorar" about a billion times before I hear Vancouver.
