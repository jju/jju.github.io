[Distant Stars](http://www.amazon.ca/Distant-Stars-Samuel-R-Delany/dp/0743486617/) is the reason I have my Samuel R. Delany book buying policy. I had no idea this book existed till I spotted it used in Aqua Books. It's a collection of short stories, the longest of which I'd read before. My favourite was Corona, about a guy who's injured in an industrial accident and then meets a telepathic little girl who wants to kill herself. And Prismatica was a pretty great fairy tale. I always like Delany's book because he mixes simplicity and complexity so well. In the introduction he says the most important thing he tries to do is figure out why cliche happens and write his way into exploring that. That's not what he says, but it's my best approximation, and the kind of important thing I need to read as I write my own shit.
