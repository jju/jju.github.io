Last week I could read [RConversation](http://rconversation.blogs.com/) without any problem.  Now?  Firewalled.  
  
Thanks again for setting up the proxy, Jeremy.  
  
Of course, RConversation is a blog that talks about China a bunch, but it's apparently all the TypePad blogs that are now gone for non-proxying folks here in the great red state.  Just like Blogspot.  LiveJournal still works.  
  
This is unrelated to the registration of bloggers, I think.  That issue was more about blogging portals than what people get to read.  But in any case it's frustrating.  RConversation is one of the most balanced and understanding reports on freedom based Chinese issues I've seen, and it's a shame to stop interested Chinese people participating in that (foreign-situated) dialgue.
