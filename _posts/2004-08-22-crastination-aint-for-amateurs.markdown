I should be working on my plan for my classes tomorrow.  I know what articles I'll deal with and how I'll introduce myself. I use a series of drawings symbolizing my life.  5 of them.  I'm easily reducible.  Alchemists love me.
  

  
I bought some groceries today so I have noodles and veggies and other basic foodstuffs.  I also watched Jeff Powell's rowing team come in fifth.  Sigh.  Then I went to play basketball with a teacher, the head of the foreign language department and his son.  I forgot the cardinal rule of playing basketball: Don't wear glasses. I bent them back into shape, but it's lucky my mom isn't here to be bugged by them.  So no more glasses at the gym.  We played pretty well.  It was me and Mr Li's son against the two teachers.  We warmed up then played 2 on 2 without keeping score for a while. Then after a cigarette break we played a couple of 5 point games which my side won.  I was called on an offensive foul (even though I was on my best behaviour, really).  It's fun being the guy who has the best chance of getting the rebounds.
