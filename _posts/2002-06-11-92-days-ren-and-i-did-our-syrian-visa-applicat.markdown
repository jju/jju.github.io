92 days.
  

  
Ren and I did our Syrian visa applications this afternoon.  Our photos make us look like quite shady characters.  I don't know if I'd let me into my country based on that.  Also got a MiniDisc recorder yesterday.  I'll pick up a microphone for it next so I'll have digital audio recording possibilities for various and sundry occasions.
  

  
No work again today.
