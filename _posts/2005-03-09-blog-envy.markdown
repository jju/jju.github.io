So sometimes I get all down on myself for not doing any real journalism kind of stuff out here.  Stuff about China that I could sell to real places.  And then I tell myself "But you blog!  That's the kind of perspectivey journalism you want to do anyway."  
  
Well this is a pretty sorry excuse for a journalistic kind of blog.  It really is in the online diary end of the medium, not any kind of cool ass funkiness.  I was reminded of this reading [a Websnark post](http://www.websnark.com/archives/2005/03/perspective.html) this afternoon.  
  
Eric Burns runs this blog that talks about different webcomics.  He tries to critique one every day.  He doesn't do hatchet jobs, but he does point out why he likes the things he does and when something fails in his opinion.  I've learned about a bunch of comics from this blog and I generally think he has interesting stuff to say.  Sometimes he gets a little earnest or self-conscious of his jokes and sometimes he takes himself too seriously as an authority but then don't we all?  
  
Anyway, that's my story.
