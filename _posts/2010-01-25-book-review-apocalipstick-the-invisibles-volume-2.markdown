There's an interview with Grant Morrison in the fourth issue of [Coilhouse](http://coilhouse.net/magazine/). It was the first thing I read in there. And before that interview I didn't realize that his 1990s book The Invisibles was a form of autobiography. If you've read The Invisibles you can see why. Anyway, I went out and bought volume 2, [Apocalipstick](http://www.librarything.com/work/66222/book/55453236) and read it.

The idea behind the Invisibles is that they're these anarchist mystics. One of the main characters is a Brazilian transvestite shaman, another is a psychic clown from the future and they stop power hungry people from doing power hungry shit, while trying slowly to free everyone.

This book had a voodoo story and a time-jumping tale of drugs and identity in the Brazilian. It's good, and most importantly weird. I think weird is important.
