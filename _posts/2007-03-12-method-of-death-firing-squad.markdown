I wrote my second story for the [Machine of Death](http://machineofdeath.net/) anthology today.  The concept only fermented for a week before writing, which is weird for me.  Often I let ideas sit for months, nay years, before they get turned into actual words on a page.  But I like this one much more than my first for the anthology, so we'll see if all this fermentation is just turning my stuff into vinegar.  I figure if either of them is picked, then I'll put the other up on this site here.
