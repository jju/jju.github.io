I just finished my first short screenplay. First draft of course. I've been taking apart stories that haven't been working as well as I'd like and been doing them in different formats. I really like how breaking the story into something different changes it and makes it better (while giving me experience in different writing formats).




It's different from writing a comics script. And I think I like the comics writing a bit better. I get more control over the pacing. I was trying to follow a classic three act structure with this even though it's short. In a comic I can break down exactly which actions get shown and which don't. This I have to let things go a bit more. Or something. I'm not entirely sure about the format. Ah well. It's not like I'm going to get it turned into a movie anytime anyway.
