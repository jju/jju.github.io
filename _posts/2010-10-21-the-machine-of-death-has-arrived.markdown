[![Machine of Death Day is October 26, 2010](http://machineofdeath.net/a/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/mod_120x240.jpg)](http://machineofdeath.net/a/mod-day)So a few years ago I wrote a story for an awesome sounding SF anthology edited by webcomic people I really like ([Ryan North](http://qwantz.com), [David Malki !](http://wondermark.com), and Matthew Bennardo who I'm not really aware of outside of this context) called [The Machine of Death](http://machineofdeath.net/a/about). It's [available now on Amazon](http://machineofdeath.net/oct26/), but if you're interested in buying it, it'd be great if you could do it on October 26 (from Amazon.com). If you want more information about the history behind the anthology and why we'd like you to buy it that day (hint: it has to do with being an indie publisher trying to make a splash), [this post should explain things a bit](http://machineofdeath.net/a/mod-day).

But, you might be saying, what is this anthology about? Well, the concept is that they're stories from a world where the Machine of Death exists. The Machine tells you how you will die. [It is infallible, but can be cryptic](http://machineofdeath.net/a/about). So the stories are funny or poignant or generally awesome. My story, Firing Squad, is about a traveller in a rebellious mountain country whose benevolence has consequences. The book has 30 or so stories, and each of them is also illustrated by cool people from webcomics. It's kind of awesome.

[So it would be great if you considered buying it (or telling someone else to buy it for you) on Amazon.com on October 26, 2010](http://machineofdeath.net/oct26/). It is Creative Commons licensed and will be available electronically for free, but actual sales are good things to encourage this kind of effort in the future. Thanks.
