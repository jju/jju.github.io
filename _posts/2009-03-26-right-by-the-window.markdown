There was a communist meeting at the library tonight and they were so shy about it. I had maybe five or six people come to the desk looking for the meeting but none of them would say what they were there for. Just muttering about the Buchwald room with shifty looks to see if anyone was overhearing. If I were having a communist party meeting I'd be all over advertising that shit. I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

Also, a patron found poop at one of the study tables along the reading terrace. She was funny, kind of laughing embarrassed, when she came to tell me. "So, this might sound kind of strange, but my friend and I.. were kind of sitting down to do some work... and we noticed... on the ground... well... y'know... some poop. I know that sounds weird." And I told her that was much less weird than she'd think. I always like when people use the word poop in public. The poop did get cleaned up and I didn't have to do it.
