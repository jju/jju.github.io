The day started off warm but within the first hour of class a big rain swept in and everyone was complaining about how cold the rooms were.  I had to meet some students who had late homework to hand in, so I was hanging around in the English Department office.  I always say English, but it's the Foreign Language Department, even though we only have one teacher of Japanese representing the rest of foreignness.
  

  
The rain hadn't stopped by the time I decided I was done waiting for Wang Wei (whose name is pronounced like the punchline to one of those "three ethnic stereotypes walk into a bar" jokes, but I'm glad to say it took a few weeks before I realized it) to bring her tardy classmates' homework.  I ran back to my apartment and spent the afternoon reading a crappy David Brin book.  There is still good science fiction out there, right?  Not good postmodern reflexive deconstructionist scifi, but good stuff with the classic tropes of other planets and things plus characters that actually behave like people.
  

  
And then when I went out for dinner, the smell of the rain put me up in Victoria Beach or something like that.  It felt like I was walking from Steveo's family's cabin down the road to the little store despite the lack of any similarity between the two places.  I have no idea how that happened, but it felt really good.
  

  
Now the DVD I was going to watch (Steamboy) decided to have a disc error so I'm just sitting inside with the stereo off listening to the rain.
