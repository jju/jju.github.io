They cut down the tree that stood between my window and the Maryland Hotel parking lot. This does not improve my view. They are putting up high chain-link fencing while they drill holes in the Maryland Hotel parking lot which doesn't improve the sonic landscape in my apartment. And they're replacing a water main out on Maryland. But the condemned house is still next door and nothing is happening with getting parking for our building. Some idiot in the building thinks he's too good for dumpsters and put their garbage outside our front door for the dogs/feral children to tear apart.

Last night I couldn't sleep for hours with my hatred of my stupid decision a year ago to buy this fucking condo. Even though we now have insurance there's not going to be an end to me hating it. We get a property management company and it's still up to the board to collect the money if they won't pay like too many of our owners won't. And the board is going to be me and Zahra because we're the only people who have any sort of sense of responsibility. 

I'm not cut out for this kind of bullshit and I just want to sell it. But there are two 2-bedroom units up for sale already and there's no parking because Roger won't do fuck all and I hate it. I just want to leave it, not even try to sell it. Or sell it at a ridiculous low price just to be rid of the fucking thing. Start over. I've got a bit of money saved.

In the midst of all this I find great joy in my work. Ha! No but seriously. I've been working on the library's Multilingual collection for the last month. Harriet has given me and the Circ people these tasks which mean we've checked in the entirety of Multilingual three times. Where if they'd done things in the right order it would have had to be done once. The joy comes in when I'm explaining to Harriet why we have so many Chinese books on hold for this project, and she flaps her arms and squawks about how she doesn't understand. So I explain it again and show her. Very calmly very patiently. She grabs Ashleigh and demands to know why she didn't catch all this when they were going over it the night before. And I explain that there's a very simple solution, but Harriet doesn't understand. Happily my job is not to make incompetent people understand their jobs, so I can just sit there adding to her confusion while I watch her tiny brain melt down. It's the most fun sort of trouble-making, to quietly show people their incompetence and watch them flail around trying to fix it. In my final weeks at SIr William I did this a bunch. Ivy saw me doing it and would get annoyed because she doesn't find incompetence as funny as I do.

Bleak spiteful amusement makes up for the condo bullshit, right?
