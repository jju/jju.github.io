Recently I was talking to Holly (and I say talking in the sense of typing) and our conversation glanced off the topic of setting goals. That's one of those things I've always found helpful about being in school. Built-in goal: graduate. In 2012 I had two big goals; graduate and get a job. I succeeded in both of those. Hooray. My basic economic needs are met. I have food and shelter and internet connections (and a fucking motorcar).

As far as goals that made me happy and fulfilled and whatever, they were pretty much inadequate. One of my friends mentioned on Facebook last week that 2012 was a successful year for him, but now the goal is to make 2013 a happier one. That sounds like a good plan to me too.

I've spent the last month trying to figure out what I need to do now. Because going to work 5 days a week and then coming home and reading isn't really cutting it. If I were in a place where I had friends then I'd be able to get by like that, because coming home and reading would be a prelude to playing games with people or going to parties or talking not in the sense of typing.

However, I'm not in a place with my friends. So it looks like this is going to be a year of trying to spend more time producing than consuming. I'm going to write more (if not blog more - sorry mom) and read less. I really liked making that [stupid little Xwing video](https://vimeo.com/56300031) on Christmas morning. I'm going to make more stuff like that. 

I'd been complaining about the amount of work it would be to do my Lego comic thing as stop-motion (even at a cut-rate 2-3fps), but fuck it. [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1295770-justin-unrau) says I read 333 books in 2012. I think I can afford to cut back a bit. Making shit may take time, but these days there's no human with a demand on it. Someday I'll be somewhere with friends and social things to do, but not right now. I'm okay with disappointing the never-ending stack of unread books by making something, and preferably something only I can make.
