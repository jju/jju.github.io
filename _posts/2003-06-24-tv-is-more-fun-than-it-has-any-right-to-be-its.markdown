TV is more fun than it has any right to be.  It's an awful medium that has contributed a bazillion times more than any of the others to short attention spans and general stupidity.  But it's so much fun to make.  We were doing some editing exercises today and my thing about a paperboy and a woman driving away was turned into a seven shot epic of the circle of life.  It was beautiful except for one jumpcut that they wouldn't let me fix.  Then we were grabbing some construction shots, which were almost all lousy.  But I'm learning to use the ol' Betacam.  There's a DV camera at the school that we can sign out for work, but I might do it for making something fun.  I just have to come up with what that might be.
