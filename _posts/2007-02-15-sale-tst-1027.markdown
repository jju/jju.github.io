I just got back from [Campaign's (Imagine Games and Hobbies)](http://imaginegames.ca/) first day in their new location.  The Grand Opening is Saturday and I'll probably stop by again.  
  
I realized walking back how weird it would have been to come back to Winnipeg without my friends.  That was kind of how it felt in there today.  I talked for a bit with Chris Allen, who I knew and Dave Violago was there but that was it.  They asked me for my name and address to go in the computer and I was sad.  I've been gone for five years and I'm nobody special there anymore.  
  
Imagine if that was what it had been like with everyone when I got back.  I'm grateful I've got real friends.
