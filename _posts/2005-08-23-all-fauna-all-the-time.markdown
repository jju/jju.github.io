Would you like to read stories about China that have very little to do with spiders?  
  

  
My fellow [organization redacted]er James has [a blog going](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=stabhav) from Chengdu.  The [August 23rd story](http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=stabhav&tab=weblogs&uid=332696925) is about the "no mere 6 Flags" roller coaster of stress that is involved in flying with a cat (who is the prettiest feline I've seen in a year) in Chinese.
  

  
If you want more Chinese (depending on your political views) spider stories check [this comment](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/2005/08/he-burst-his-hot-hearts-shell-upon-it.html#c112472633070237575).
