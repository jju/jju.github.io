[The Enchantress of Florence](http://www.amazon.ca/Enchantress-Florence-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0676977596/) is Salman Rushdie's latest. It tells the story of that enchantress in a fragmented way and the story of the person telling the story in, dare I say a more fragmented one? Machiavelli is a character as is Amerigo Vespucci's cousin and Argalia the Turk who fights with four albino swiss giants at his side. The Argalia part of the story reminded me muchly of [The Baroque Cycle](http://www.amazon.ca/Quicksilver-Baroque-Cycle-1-Stephenson/dp/0380977427/) with its derring do and Barbary pirates and such. But there's also an imaginary queen and a very wise advisor and a lot of very canny whores. I liked it, but wished the story hadn't been tied to periods of history I know so little about. It felt like there were a lot of things that were fictional alongside the historical, and I wish I knew a bit more about which was which. So yes, my main complaint was about my own ignorance. Selah.
