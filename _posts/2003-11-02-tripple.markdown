I sort of slept this afternoon while I's supposed to be dealing with my Media & Politics presentation.  It's been too long since I'd woken up in my own bed without an alarm kicking my ass to do it.  It seems like an entire week went by of stressful wakeups after too short sleeps.  Kind of nice to nap.

Now I have to gear up to pretend to care about the football I'm going to watch against the Saskies (cause there's no way I'm watching it with them).  It will be an effort of my will that makes the Bombers win if they do today.  I apologize to everyone and take full responsibility if I am not strong enough.  Don't hurt me.
