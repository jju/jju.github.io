Today was beautiful outside.  Sunny and warm and I didn't have anywhere I needed to be.  So I went down to the Forks and sat by the river and read and felt like I was in Nanchong.  No one was swimming in our river, but I was right near a bridge and the water sure was muddy.  Eventually I got a smoothie and ruined the illusion but until then it was all good.  Oh, and I wandered through a French bookstore in St. Boniface just to get a bit of that "I'm not at home" feeling.
