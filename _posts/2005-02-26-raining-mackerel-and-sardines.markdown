I've pinpointed why the review I read of Kafka on the Shore has been bugging me.  It completely missed the point of the book.  Murakami's doing a Murakami story with definite echoes of some of the other books and the review didn't mention it at all.  
  
True, I'd have been pissed off if how it worked was revealed, but if it had just said that it's about divided selves, like Sputnik Sweetheart was, I'd have been happy instead of having some sort of weird sense of foreboding that the book wasn't Murakami-ish.    
  
Never again will I read a review of a book I have faith in before reading said book.  Nasty paranoia-inducing things.
