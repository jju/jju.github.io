It's been a very Mennonite kind of afternoon here in ... I've got no putonghua for "Casa de Justin" that would make sense or convey the sense of Panama hats, Coronas, and corruption that it'd need.  
  
First, Miss Wang came over with a repair guy to fix the water that was spraying from my washing machine when I tried to do laundry.  This was the result from those guys fixing the leak on Saturday, that I only discovered last night.  He did most of the fixing.  I think she just wanted to get out of the office for half an hour.  But she told me that I might be moving to a new apartment next semester.  One with 65% less dank!  So that's cool.  
  
(If you don't see how that had anything to do with Mennoniteness, you just aren't trying.)  
  
Second, in my mail was a card from [Charleswood Mennonite](http://www.cwoodchurch.org/), my church back in Winnipeg (which has a website in English now!  For the longest time it was only in Korean).  It wasn't signed and didn't say anything of importance but there it was, confusing Miss Wang.  Whoever addressed it wrote my name in cursive on the envelope.  If you aren't used to it handwriting looks like Arabic, I guess.  Miss Wang only guessed it was for me because the stamp said it was from Canada.  
  
Third, the [Canadian Mennonite](http://www.canadianmennonite.org/) that I just received had an article about [Mennonite blogs](http://www.canadianmennonite.org/vol09-2005/9-08/artsculture.php).  And didn't mention me.  Just because I'm not ruminating on sermons and occasionally use colourful language they think I can be ignored.  Jerks!  All of them!  Well, maybe not [all](http://www.canadianmennonite.org/vol09-2005/9-08/inconversation.php#article2).
