I can't believe how crappy I feel.  And it's all self-inflicted.  I flopped down on the couch this afternoon after writing up some comics (_[le pingouink](http://webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink/)_ has an "at least one silent panel for effect" theme this week, so the translation efforts went much more quickly than usual) and watched TV for like five or six hours.  I mean, to illustrate the depths I sank to: I watched an episode and a half of American Dad.  And is it just me, or is Family Guy not funny at all anymore?    
  
Maybe I'm just spoiled.  We watched six episodes of [Fishing With John](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139776/) at Reyn's last night.  "The fishermen awake, covered in sores and boners."  Can you argue with that?  'Cause I can't.  And it (FwJ) gave me an idea for another comic I might have to do.  It'll be a bit more involved in terms of graphics than _le pingouink_, so it might be a once a week kind of deal.  I guess my TV time was spent doing a lot of the heavy conceptual work that is the key to all these creative endeavours.    
  
No it wasn't.  It was brain shut off time.  Because my life is so freakin' stressful.
