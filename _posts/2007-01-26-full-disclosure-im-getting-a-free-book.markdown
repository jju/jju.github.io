The other day I got an email asking me to look into this [BooksPrice.com](http://www.booksprice.com) website.  The idea is that you punch in the book you're looking for and it compares prices (including shipping) from a bunch of different online sellers and gives you the cheapest one.  It's a good idea and it looks like it'd work pretty well.  It automatically puts the prices in Canadian dollars when I say I want shipping to Canada, so it seems like it's at least pan-North American friendly.  I'm going to try it out in the next couple of weeks once I've paid my VISA bill.  
  
My favourite part of this whole interaction was actually trying to figure out if the original email that brought my attention to this was spam or not.  It seems that it isn't.  I've exchanged a few emails with Lucy now and she's very personable and is aware that it could seem fishy/phishy to people.  It seems she's doing the right kind of thing marketing-wise; it just runs up against cynical internetters who expect no free lunch.  Or book.
