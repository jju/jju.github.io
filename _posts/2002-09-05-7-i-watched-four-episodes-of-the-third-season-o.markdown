I watched four episodes of the third season of the Sopranos last night.  My mom just bought the third season on DVD.  I saw it in Minneapolis for $79.99 US.  She got it here for $83.79 CDN.  I was amazed at Dr. Melfi's rape in episode four.  I realize it's the Sopranos and they're pretty unflinching about stuff, but to have the entire rape on camera, no cutaways, no pulling up to look at the ceiling while hearing her scream, just focusing on her, wow.
  

  
The other day I read Timequake by Kurt Vonnegut.  It was the perfect book to read for me right now.  I feel like I've been trapped in a rerun of reality like the book's eponymous cosmic event (please tell me if I've used eponymous incorrectly; I think it's right and it feels right but it could be wrong).  In a week, free will is going to kick in for me.  Choices I make will make some sort of a difference rather than how I'm just letting myself be pulled along by paths of least resistance.  I'm very looking forward to it.  I don't need an 80 year old man to come running in shouting Paul Revere like "Free Will! Free Will!"  I've been waiting. I've been preparing.  That's what quitting at Campaign was about: an exercise in free will.  Just exerting myself against the universe a touch.  This has been an important summer for me.  It really marked the end of something.  I don't see it as quite the same as Big Loud's change to a "me, my family, my career" kind of direction, but I could be wrong.  I've spent 22 years collecting skills and experiences in order to get me ready for something, but I don't know what it is yet.  I just know I won't (indeed I can't since my Cake concert trade) be wearing a tie to do it.  It's like I'm entering the homestretch and I really don't want to die in the next two years, because I'm close, so close to maybe doing something.  My dad only lived to be 23 and a half, but he was doing something, while I've been collecting and delaying.
  

  
One week tomorrow I'm gone.
