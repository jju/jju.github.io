At work last night security guards were hanging around the men's washroom on the fourth floor while I was reading the shelves. There was a guy inside who was using a toilet that was out of order, but he was a drunk homeless guy and they weren't sure if he was actually using it or just hiding or what. Eventually he emerged but only after I got to listen to what library security guards discuss on their radios. It's not terribly exciting.

But I started reading a new book about philosophers [Wittgensteins Poker by David Edmonds](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=057120547X%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/057120547X%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002). It's a million times more accessible than [Kant and the Platypus](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=015601159X%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/015601159X%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) but that's mostly because it's about personality clashes in one instant than it is about huge ideas. I mean, the clashes happen because they differ on big ideas. Yeah. But I did learn that my favourite linguistic tidbit is known as Moore's Paradox. Also, did you know that tidbit is actually just Bowdlerized because Americans felt dirty saying titbit?
