I'm back from Fuling, which was a very pointless trip.  In the car on the way back (which was the first trip in China that I've put a seatbelt on for) Miss Wang was going over how much it had cost, and sort of seemed to be implying how grateful we should be.  Not overtly implying, just a little.
  

  
Which was funny because I felt like the whole thing was me doing her a favour.  I could have been in Nanchong for Dan's going away party.
