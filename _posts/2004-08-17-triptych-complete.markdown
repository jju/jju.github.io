Beijing opera?  Check.  Nasal and whiny to the Western ear to such an extent that it provokes giggles in the audience that arrived by tourist bus (or cabs).
  

  
Beijing duck? Check.  Fatty and bland, with something like hoisin sauce wrapped in pancakes and green onions and cucumbers.
  

  
Pekingese dogs?  Check.  All over the place they belong walking without bending their knees and wearing happy little faces content that they're ugly sons (and daughters) of bitches.
