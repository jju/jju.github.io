So I have a Facebook thing now.  Hassie and Jackie have said it gets very addicting.  The thing that tipped me over into getting more friends than just the two of them is that I can collect all the Notes and posts and shit into one RSS feed, which then shows up in my normal stuff during the day.  I don't have to actually go to the site to do stuff.  
  
Working two days in a row is more tiring than I would have thought.
