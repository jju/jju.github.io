The interview went very well, but I'm second in seniority so it rests on whether the first person turns the position down or not. But there's another position coming up in Special Services and this interview counts for that too. So if I don't get this one but am senior for the next one, they won't re-interview me, just offer me the job. There's a non-zero chance the person ahead of me won't take this one, because it's an every Sunday package whereas the other one will be a 2/3 Sundays with more weekday evenings. It rests not in my hands right now.

And I haven't looked at my stories for tomorrow yet. I should have lots of time tomorrow though as I work at 1:15. The kids don't arrive till 6:30ish.
