That was tiring.  Big Loud and an African were here since Wednesday morning and now they're riding the millenium beast home through lands that have not been kind to it.  fakeLondon is a Tipperarian distance from Winnipeg, so there was a bit of sleeping involved in their visit.  We also bought far too much beer (thanks for leaving it behind) and hung out with rrrrrrRachel and Ash, wandered around both in fL and the TO.  Also saw Kathleen Saurette (shit, are there two r's in that?) for the first time in over 5 years I do believe.  I will be coming back to Winnipeg on my summer break at the end of August expressly so that I can go to a 3(! Sean joined the club) nargileh party, since "oh, they're too fragile to bring to FolkFest."  Now I sort of have work to do, but I'm a lazy man (Lopez).
