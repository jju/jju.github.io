I was out walking tonight and saw a completely round headed 10 year old kid.  Like the complete Charlie Brown deal.  Well, he was wearing green, but he had only a tiny bit of hair kind of curled onto his forehead.  And he was smoking a cigarette, blowing the smoke into his friend's face with glee - complete and utter abandon the likes of which old Chuck has never known.  I bet he'd get to kick the football sometime if he wore green and was smoking some Marlboros.  
  
Also I posted a new little thing in the Journalism section of the site called [Red China Blizzard](http://www.djs5.com/hjp/journalism.html#blizzard).  It's below Guerrilla Words because I don't feel the need to maintain the reverse chronology over there.  That's a blogging thing.
