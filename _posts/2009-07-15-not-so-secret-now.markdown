So our entire department at the library is being hauled (one-by-one) into the administration offices in the next couple of days for secret meetings. We were asked not to talk about this with people in other departments, so if you're in some other department you didn't hear it from me. I only mention it here in case I don't come back (my session is on Thursday).

After the three of us who were on desk yesterday were informed there was nervousness and pondering of what it might be about. My suggestion that they were throwing us individualized surprise parties with cake and balloons was met with skepticism.

Yeah, I'm having a great week.
