From the Washington Post since CBC.ca doesn't have it yet: [Kurt Vonnegut Dies at 84](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041200062.html):

<blockquote>The author of at least 19 novels, many of them best-sellers, as well as dozens of short stories, essays and plays, Vonnegut relished the role of a social critic. He lectured regularly, exhorting audiences to think for themselves and delighting in barbed commentary against the institutions he felt were dehumanizing people.  
  
"I will say anything to be funny, often in the most horrible situations," Vonnegut, whose watery, heavy-lidded eyes and unruly hair made him seem to be in existential pain, once told a gathering of psychiatrists.   
  
...  
  
"We probably could have saved ourselves, but we were too damned lazy to try very hard ... and too damn cheap," he once suggested carving into a wall on the Grand Canyon, as a message for flying-saucer creatures.  
  
</blockquote>

Timequake is still one of the best books I ever read.
