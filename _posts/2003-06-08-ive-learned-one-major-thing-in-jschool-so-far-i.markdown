I've learned one major thing in jschool so far.  It is that I have huge problems talking to people I don't know.  Funny, since that's sort of a biggish part of the whole journalism thing.  Last night I hit a big trough and generally couldn't function at all.  I'm better today because I've got something to hang my story about the 24 hour relay on (or with, in any case it'll get done).  To deal with this whole phenomenon I'm looking at the areas where I can talk to people naturally.  It all comes down to roleplaying; I can't decide if that is sad or not.  So I'm working on creating a role that will allow me to talk to people.  It's kind of the Batman mentality; putting on a mask to become another person (though Batman's real mask is the Bruce Wayne persona; his cape and cowl are the him he's hiding).  Which I cannot help thinking might be unhealthy.
  

  
When Reyn and I were away, I looked forward to coming back to Canada because here I'd be on my own turf; I wouldn't automatically be wrong because I was the ignorant foreigner.  The thing is that I'm not so all over being on my own turf, in a culture that I should be able to navigate.  It's just pointing out to me how shitty I am at doing it.  My Hinduism prof in 4th year talked about how lots of people go the ascetic route and withdraw from the world not because it's such a good idea, but because they just can't deal with life in the world.  The more I think about it, the more I miss wandering around strange cities without a purpose, my favourite withdrawal.
