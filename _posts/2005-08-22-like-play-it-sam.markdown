A brief followup to last night's epic battle.  It's not only here that has these horrid arachnids; they've begun a campaign against journalists [across Asia](http://kneuroknut.blogspot.com/2005/08/crawlies-in-weave.html).
  

  
One of the other results was a great deal of disillusionment.  I wanted a Moby Dick quote, and the one that leaped into my head was "If his chest was a cannon he'd have fired his heart upon it."  I Googled it to make sure I'd gotten the word order right.  In that Googling I discovered that that line isn't in Moby Dick at all; it's Captain Picard's line in Star Trek: First Contact.  He's talking about Moby Dick and makes it sound like a direct quote, and that was the one I remembered.  But in the book it's actually about a mortar and bursting hot hearts, which presumably Star Trek viewers wouldn't understand (though Picard obviously would have).
  

  
So I was sad that my Star Trek geekiness made me mistake a dumbed down version of Moby Dick for the real thing.  I love Moby Dick.
