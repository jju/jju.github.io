Man, I'm blogging a lot today.  Selah. 
  

  
From the San Francisco Gate: [China's official Catholics cautiously mourn pope's passing](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/06/MNGBBC3S631.DTL)

<blockquote>The Vatican estimates that China is home to 12 million Catholics, only a third of whom worship in the country's legal, government-sanctioned churches. So millions of Catholics across the nation who are not part of the official "patriotic church" remembered the pope and expressed fealty to the Vatican last weekend in private homes and makeshift, illegal churches.</blockquote>

Now people like my friends Jeannette and Todd (MEd) would know better than I if that 12 million number is accurate, but I don't think they'd get too angry at the article (like Todd (MEd) sometimes gets about others).
  

  
Often all the West hears about Christianity in China is how it is underground in "makeshift, illegal churches."  We are supposed to feel sorry for the poor Christians cowering in the dark from the heathens.  It's funny because those illegal churches have actual buildings and things.  Like big four storey things that are called training centres.  I'm sure there are problems and things, and people are in jail (how I'd be able to verify that I don't know) but it's not like there're people with big clubs whacking the Christians.
  

  
The thing that confused me in this article was how in the third paragraph the Reverend Lu said "We do not practice his teachings" and it wasn't explained.  That kind of implies that the Chinese church isn't a real church or something (I don't know how catholics operate but the pope seems pretty important to be ignored).
  

  
What I liked about this article is that it talks about the political realities of appointing bishops and things and the Taiwan issue.  I didn't know that the Vatican recognized Taiwan.
