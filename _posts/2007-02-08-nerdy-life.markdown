I'm in the process of making the shift from Bloglines to Google Reader.  I think.  If this works there might be a bit more integration between what I read and what I post here.  I already use Gmail as my main email interface.  This whole web based application thing has its advantages, but it's crappy when the internets are all clogged up or I have to *gasp* unplug my computer from the wall.
