_Why yes I am posting a press release.  It's what real journalists do when they are too lazy to go to Indonesia or Pennsylvania themselves._  
  
**MCC ramps up for a $1.4 million response to victims of Asian tsunamis**   
  
Dec. 30, 2004   
  
AKRON, PA -- Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) has begun a $1.4 million dollar immediate and long-term response to devastation left behind by the southern Asia earthquake and tsunamis that have killed over 100,000 people in eight countries, one third of them children.  Hundreds of thousands more have been injured and millions left homeless.  The response includes the purchase of 2,000 metric tons of grain for distribution in affected areas of India.   
  
The total figure includes some $12,000 Cdn./$10,000 U.S. for medical and water purification equipment and supplies to be airlifted through Church World Service; three containers of canned meat worth $180,000 Cdn./$150,000 U.S.; 2,000 metric tons of grain through the Canadian Foodgrains Bank worth some $800,000 Cdn./$700,000 U.S.; and some $660,000 Cdn./$550,000 U.S.   
  
Additional funds for local purchase of food, water, clothing, fuel and health items, as well as employment and reconstruction, have been requested by partner agencies in India and Sri Lanka. As the tragic situation in Indonesia continues to unfold MCC expects to further increase its response.  MCC is sending an assessment team to India and Sri Lanka on Wednesday, Jan. 5, to join their local and national staff in assessing the situation for further response.   
  
"Part of the reason this event is so devastating is that people in the areas affected have lost absolutely everything and are now needing to rebuild from scratch," said Ronald J. R. Mathies, Executive Director of MCC.   
  
To meet immediate and long term needs in India, MCC will be working with the India Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) to develop a food for community development program allowing people to clean up their communities, rebuild homes, replant fields and prevent internal migration of people to other areas of the country. The food is provided through the Canadian Foodgrains Bank, a coalition of Christian churches and agencies, including MCC.   
  
"The goal of this effort is to allow people to begin restoring their dignity and livelihoods," said Willie Reimer, MCC Director of Food, Disaster and Material Resources.   
  
In Sri Lanka, MCC staff are working with local partner, Y-GRO, a Sri Lankan church-based development agency, by assisting local churches packaging relief supplies and accompanying a medical team to areas damaged by the tsunamis. MCC worker, Mark Oxley, along with two doctors and other volunteers, traveled this past Wednesday to disaster areas.  They will return to Colombo this weekend. Y-GRO is a member of a consortium of humanitarian organizations in Sri Lanka.  In Indonesia an MCC staff worker, Pak Abang, will be part of an assessment team visiting the devastation in north Sumatra, the area closest to the earthquake's epicenter.   
  
Currently MCC has 10 North American workers, along with five children, in Indonesia. There are two workers and two children in Sri Lanka; five workers in India; and one worker in Thailand. There are dozens of local workers in the affected areas.  All MCC workers are safe.   
  
Donations can be made to the Asia Earthquake Fund by calling 1-888-563-4676 or logging onto the MCC Web Site, www.mcc.org/asiaearthquake.  Interviews with MCC staff in India and Indonesia are available through the MCC Communications Department.
