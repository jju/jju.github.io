I've been asked to put a live realtime weather tracker on the site.  Here it is (and it'll be updated every minute on the minute until May): It's freakin' cold.  Just scroll down to this post whenever you're wondering how it feels in Justin's apartment.  "Wow," you'll say, "It's a bit chilly."    
  
I should never go anywhere to see how the other teachers from my unnameable organization live.  I could walk into apartments in Chongqing and take off my coat and toque.  And sit on furniture that isn't made solely of wood.  No, I'm not bitter, why do you ask?  
  
We went to a hotel buffet for American Thanksgiving on Saturday, and I made off with a stash of books from my colleagues, plus a Christmas present for one lucky reader.  Is it you?
