I am not a very good student here.  That is my biggest frustration right now.  Not that I'm not learning Chinese (which I am) but that the way I need to learn it and the way that people try to teach me don't sync up at all.  It ends in frsutration and then three days later I get the answers I was asking for.  I suppose this is what my students'll feel like when I subject them to classes so it's good for me.  But it still pisses me off.
  

  
I mean, I know I'm supposed to be culturally sensitive but I want to be able to have my personal reactions as well.  I suppose I'm just too individualistic which is a wasteful North American thing that makes everyone suffer, but bloody hell, I'm not just a wasteful North American, I'm me.
  

  
Yes I realize this'll get a lot worse before it gets better.
