Yesterday there was a huge (huge) pile of geeks using some of our rooms for a Silverlight vs Flash throwdown (organizer's words). They had like a million pizzas to bring in. We had to open the emergency exit to the skywalk for them so the forklift could get through. The downside for the rest of the library was that everyone could smell the pizza. More than a few patrons went mad with the aroma. Of course they were patrons who rarely eat anyway, so twas to be expected. The saddest part of the evening was when all the geeks were leaving and so many of them were carrying pizza boxes with them. I'd harboured a smidge of hope that even a couple of hundred geeks couldn't eat a million pizzas in just under three hours, and that surely there would be some leftovers for us hardworking staff who unlocked their doors and let them steal our mac adapters. But no. All the pizzas marched out the door. Ashleigh made a comment about how sometimes it was like we'd never been fed, how badly we wanted the leftovers of fragrantly delicious things. Well I hadn't been fed yet that day. Their organizer gave us a leftover sixpack of diet coke. I took one home and saved it till tonight. It still tastes like ashes in my mouth, despite being about two-thirds whisky.

Today no one had food. Not even three weeks past due chocolate chip-pecan cookies like we sometimes get. Those come from a patron and no one never exactly knows why or wherefrom. 

Tonight I debated the significance of using "no problem" as opposed to "your welcome" with a couple of pages  on my way to drop off the cash. One of the pages was [the slow one I know I've mentioned (let's call him RN)](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2007/06/07/gratuitous-cheap-shot/) and the other was a bright 19-year-old who was very nice about trying to include RN in conversation, asking about least favourite words. She said she hated the word "moist" which is a fairly usual view, the internet tells me. RN doesn't like the word "were." I felt bad pressing on that in the elevator with my: "You mean you don't like the idea that things existed in the past, in groups? As individuals they'd be okay? Or is it the past you have issue with?" Of course that went over his head, and was probably just putting me in some sort of jerkass dick display. He followed up with "And what does 'at' mean anyway?" I managed to refrain from snideness.
