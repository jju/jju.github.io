Remember the last time I went to Chongqing feeling kind of crappy and then came back more disgruntled.  Nanchong doesn't do that to me.  I like Nanchong.  
  
I had an apartment (technically an office, but it had a mattress) to myself for sleeping, a small child to watch the Tigger Movie (and Mary Poppins, and Dumbo) and colour with, Christmas extravaganzas to attend and Saskie jokes to make.  Plus someone to talk to and laugh with and watch knit till early in the morning (and gates that were mercifully unlocked).  
  
I don't know, it was just sort of vaguely Christmassy and good.
