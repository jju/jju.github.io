Tomorrow is going to be a major writing day. I'm working on an RPG scenario I'm trying to sell and a short story for a contest. I'm glad these things came up because I've been blathering around doing nothing of any consequence since finishing part one of the novel a couple of weeks ago. Part two is just being a jerk. Moving forward on something feels good. Especially something that could possibly put a dent in a rent cheque some day.

I've been put in charge of a massive "moving shit around" campaign at work this Sunday. Taking surplus shelves from one area to the second floor, counting the good shelves on the fourth and bringing them down to the second, taking bookends from the cage to the back room. This is what I get for not staring blankly at Jeff last week when he was getting us to cart similar stuff around.

Three weeks till I go visit Holly!
