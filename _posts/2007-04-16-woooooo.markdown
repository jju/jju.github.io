That's the sound of an exhale after a really nice day.  I got work done in the morning (on a bunch of scattered projects, but each took an incremental step towards awesomeness) and then Reyn and I went out to enjoy the sunshine and not work.  We kicked around the ol' hackey sack (I insert the 'e' so as not to offend the good people at Wham-O) for an hour and a half down at the Forks and then got smoothies.  I have been inspired to do more shit like that this year, being home to enjoy the Winnipeg summer and all.  And also, [real life doesn't happen on the internet](http://fallingdown7times.blogspot.com/2007/04/another-bandwagon-i-willfully-miss.html).
