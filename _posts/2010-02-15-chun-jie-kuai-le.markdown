I went out to buy cat food around noon today, and walking down Cumberland it smelled like China (except cold). It took me a few seconds to realize the smell was incense from the [Huasing temple](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=temple+cumberland+winnipeg&sll=49.881805,-97.152786&sspn=0.320335,0.620041&ie=UTF8&hq=temple+cumberland&hnear=Winnipeg,+MB,+Canada&ll=49.899721,-97.157679&spn=0,359.961247&t=h&z=15&layer=c&cbll=49.89966,-97.1575&panoid=6KUyygs_N-lRAZLLKQvuFw&cbp=12,22.44,,0,-2.04). There were tonnes of cars parked on the surrounding streets and people were coming out the front doors putting their sticks of incense in the cauldronnish thing out front. Happy new year.

I also went out to McNally Robinson to spend the gift certificate I received from my fellow cheese factorians, and then watched some Flames of War gaming down at Imagine before heading to the Towne for The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. I liked the movie but was also glad I didn't spend $12 to see it at Silver City.
