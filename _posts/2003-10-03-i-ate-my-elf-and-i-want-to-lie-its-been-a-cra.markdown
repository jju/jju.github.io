It's been a crappy day here in the land of me.  But it's my own fault so what the hell.  My TV interviews all got messed about so now I have way too much to do on Monday and Tuesday.  Nobody will contact me back, the bastards.  Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Hopefully I'll be able to pull something together out of this piece of flaming shit.  Oh, did I mention that there was something wonky with the camera I was using today so all my wideshots are wicked blurry?And breathe and I'll pretend I'm okay now.

We did our first half hour newscast on Wednesday and that went really well.  I was the local reporter and just went out and whipped off a story.  All by myself, a regular Robert Rodriguez.

Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck
