I had my first political discussion with someone today.  Alex and I were hanging out in the afternoon and conversation turned to religion.  He asked if I listened to some English Bible hour on the radio here, and I told him that I didn't because people who host and phone into those shows are all idiots.  Then we got into FG and Tibetan Buddhism and he was telling me about all the evil things that Li Hsien Sheng (I have no idea what the FG leader's name is and my Internet won't let me look it up) and the Dalai Lama do.  Like force people to cut open their own bellies and pull out their guts as a sacrifice.  I told Alex how we don't hear about things like that in Canada.

Then he started on me for how the west gets mad at China for violating human rights but the west doesn't understand that China needs to have a one-child policy.  I explained that I was pretty sure most people didn't have such a huge problem with that policy; it was the jailing and executing of people who disagree with the government that was the sticky point.  He tried to get onto Taiwan, but I just don't know enough about that to have an opinion.

The good thing is that Alex isn't a student of mine so I don't have to play the teacher with him and can just argue if I feel like it.

So hopefully I'll still be able to access my website tomorrow.
