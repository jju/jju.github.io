I've taught my first class.  119 left.  This term.  They won't all feel that long.  Please god don't let them all feel that long.
  

  
In other news, it seems that my cousin Austin is now married to a wonderful woman named Darlene.  The wedding went off relatively as planned, as far as I've heard. Congratulations.
