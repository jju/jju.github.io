So Tuesday I gave the two students who'd failed my newspaper course last semester their retest.  And the girl who wrote it (Amanda) wasn't the girl who failed (Helen, whose name Amanda wrote on the paper).  So she cheated.  Sent in a ringer in the hopes that I wouldn't notice.  Now here's where it gets interesting.  I mark the exam anyway.  Amanda did even worse than Helen did the first time around.  On the first exam Amanda had gotten in the 80s.  This time she got 58.  
  
What happens to them?  This morning I went into the English Department, explained the problem and said I'd give the new even crappier mark to both girls.  That means Amanda's good mark for the course becomes a mediocre mark and Helen still fails.  They said that sounded fine to them.  
  
This afternoon Helen phones me telling me how she couldn't come to write the exam because she was teaching on Tuesday.  She already has a job, you see, and if she fails this course she'll lose it, so could I please give her another chance?  I said I'd see what the people in the department had to say about it and she went on insincerely about how kind I was.  
  
Personally I'd say Fuck it; you chose to cheat so you pay the consequences.  But I realize that this was just a nothing course to her and I don't want her to lose her job over something so trivial.  But I also don't want to have to go make up a whole fucking 'nother exam for this girl because she couldn't figure out a schedule.
