Okay, it's not quite [this](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-06-07&res=l) big, but there is a spider in my room the size of my hand.  My fucking hand!  I tried killing it with the biggest cardboard box I could find, but all I did was knock it off the wall and it scurried under my bed.  
  

  
It's funny 'cause I'd just killed the first cockroach I'd seen outside the kitchen in my room and had been pretty proud of myself.  Then I saw this thing on my wall and I ran.  Then I thought I must have been imagining how big it was, only a quick look and stuff.  Nope.  It was huge.  
  

  
I would have taken a picture but I don't want to have that kicking around on my computer.  As it is I'm jumping at everything in my peripheral vision that might be giant spider movement.
  

  
Two years is doable without sleep, right?
