Alright, I got some commenting action going on here now so firing can commence at any time.  Today was such a sweet day.  I woke up and read Dance Dance Dance all day.  I finished A Wild Sheep Chase last night when I got home and got through 332 pages of DDD (the sequel) through the day till now.  (First Comment that'll be logged: "Shut up Justin.  Everyone knows you read a lot.  Who the hell are you trying to impress with a page count, fucknard?" But the real question is who will be the one to say it.)  I paused only to pick up a new shirt, replace my watch with the randomly spinning minute hand, and chat with Fancy Cam while knocking over his tiny customers (there was a kid in a suit and a kid wearing a Harley leather jacket in the store at the same time. We were slightly worried for the suit kid).  I'll go on about Murakami and his books some other time, if I haven't already.
  
I shared the The The/Hank Williams CD with the first person outside of Campaign yesterday and I realized that I have absolutely no business liking this disc so much.  I don't like Hank Williams.  I couldn't care less about The The.  The songs sure as hell don't make me feel happy, but I've never had my heart broken by a cheating woman so it's not like I should really identify with the pain involved.  Curiouser and curiouser.
