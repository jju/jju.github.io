Yesterday was filled with gaming.  I played Eurorails with Reyn and Greg and Ben for hours, ate some pizza then played Necromunda with Reyn (testing out the Space Hulk tiles and rules mods for an upcoming slave rescue scenario), then played a mission of Space Hulk.  It was something like 12 hours of game playing good times.  With interruptions and stuff, but still.  
  
Also, I'm almost done a story I've been working on and then can turn my attentions to being a Young Prophet.
