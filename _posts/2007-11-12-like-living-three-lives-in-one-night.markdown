I had one of those sleeps I love last night. The kind where you wake up from vivid adventurous dreams and get to hold on to an image or two while you sweat and you're not sure if you might be getting feverishly sick but after you cement the image in your mind you fall back asleep and let it happen again. And it does.

Plus, I wasn't actually getting sick!
