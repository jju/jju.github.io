Reyn's neighbours have put a new roof on their house. Not structurally. They just put red vinyl siding (probably designed for roofing, so it'd be more like topping) over their crappy old shingles. The upside to this is that on the south side of the second floor here, the sun reflects in off that red roof, making everything near the windows kind of pink. If you are sallow and want to look a little less so, come on over!
