You'll be pleased to know I'll soon be done with this series, as [A Storm of Swords](http://www.amazon.ca/Storm-Swords-Book-Three-Song/dp/055357342X/) is book three of four that exist so far in George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. And things continued apace with war and the politics of kings. This book saw a bit more magic showing up and weddings that went really badly. Martin has no compunction against fucking up best-laid plans. It's gotten to the point where I hate to read any characters coming up with a plan because you know that nothing good will come of it. Not because the plans are bad but because other people are already making plans. There's also more religion showing up, and good things happened to a couple of characters, which means I'm kind of scared to read the next book.
