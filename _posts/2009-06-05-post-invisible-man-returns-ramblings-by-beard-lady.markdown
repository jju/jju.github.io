Just to be clear: the following is what I remember of our conversation. I wasn't saying these things. 

<blockquote>"I don't listen to what they say in the movie. I'm reading the dictionary and admiring the dermatology and wondering why no one ever discovers immortality because despite their perfect faces and no beards they're all dead and dust and if they'd looked for immortality instead of invisibility then they might be more like the highlander and why was he killing this guy and that guy."

"No one will ever help me out. I've got nothing to lose not like John Travolta and Sophia Loren. You've got your jobs so you can't say anything. That's all right, but me I don't have anything and if I could I'd be researching immortality because nobody's done it. I'm a philologist and philology is great with the 150 thousand words I hold in my head and if I were rich I'd hire someone to listen to you while I said everything I wanted to say."

"'Tell Me More' this paper says well I say Tell Me Less. And here we are in the library filled with lies and none of you have anything significant on your t-shirt. [Here I interject that my Tshirt has a very insightful Utahraptor on it.] I'm talking about people and I can't listen to that insignificant. I don't want to pan- pan- pan- IC! Ah philology. I handed out business cards every day this week and I never get anywhere. But you can't give up on a dictionary."</blockquote>

I feel bad having fun with this since well, last night I dreamt about how to spell Tron when drawing out the vowel for a long time. In the dream I was in a sleeping bag in an attic working on this problem while Jared and Sean were out living the high life. They clambered up the ladder to this attic and I pretended I was asleep so they wouldn't ask if I'd finished. So really who am I to make fun of someone else's crazy when I keep my own locked inside?
