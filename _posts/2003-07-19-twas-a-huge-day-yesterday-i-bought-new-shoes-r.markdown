I bought new shoes.  Regular ordinary shoes as opposed to hiking boots.  They're classic black airwalks that I got for half price.  5 years my gray onestars lasted, but Ultimate is killing them.  I go skidding across the field and end up wrapped in a mangled heap around the legs of whoever I'm trying to cover when he stops.  They are being relegated to tier two shoes, suitable for biking and hacking (oh but they've got some good snap to the toes). They were great shoes but holes were forming in the soles and sides.  Oh, and Dave's getting married.
