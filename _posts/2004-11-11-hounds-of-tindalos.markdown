I was just interviewed for the college newspaper.  It was exactly the same kind of thing that I get at English corner every time I go (like I will tonight).  
  

  
English corner might be an unfamiliar term for you.  I don't know why they call it this.  Ours is in a park.  In Nanchong I went to one that was in a square.  The basic idea is to give students a place to speak English.  It's usually first-years who aren't sick to fucking death of it yet.  I've been a pretty good sport.  I go and endure the same shit every time.  Someday I'll be ready to suffocate anyone who asks what my college life was like but it isn't yet.  Soon, though.  The stabbiness is building in my soul.
  

  
It was weird being interviewed because the reporter, Rainbow, kept on talking about herself the whole time.  I learned a hell of a lot more about her than she did about me I'm sure.
  

  
(There was supposed to be another post before this but ecto is crashing and eating them for some reason.)
