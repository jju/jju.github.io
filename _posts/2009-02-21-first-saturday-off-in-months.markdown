My mom is getting married today. I will look snazzy.

Last night I played D&D (4th Edition) and it was more fun than the previous time, but man, D&D is not the game for me. I read what some people say about how much fun 4E is, but I just don't see it. Our combat went four rounds and took around an hour (it's not finished). I can't remember how long the combats in our Traveller game have been, but it feels like a lot more stuff happens. And the stuff that happens is less "Okay, I do something that knocks down a bunch of things some amount of hit points" and more "I close the distance and jam my shotgun into his face" which to me seems more evocative. I don't know.

Maybe it's just the players. The D&D group doesn't describe a lot of stuff or go in for a lot of in character comments. There's no way the Tea Party incident could happen in that game. It's not bad, just a very different kind of group and game than I'm used to. I'm glad it's not my only gaming I've got happening these days.
