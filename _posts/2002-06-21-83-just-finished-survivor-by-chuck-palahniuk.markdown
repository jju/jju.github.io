83
  

  
Just finished Survivor, by Chuck Palahniuk.  Better than Invisible Monsters, but I think I liked Choke better.  The big problem with Invisible monsters for me was the fact that the narrator was a woman.  I couldn't get Chuck Palahniuk out of my head and the gender bending of the narrator just bugged me, and that was the first book that bothered me in.  Of course genderbending is kind of important to that whole book, but I kind of felt it distracting.  Also, you'll notice that I don't list Fight Club in my ranking system.  The main reason for that is Fight Club was a movie for me first, and I think the movie was better.  But I also think Fight Club is one of the most important movies of the late twentieth century, so the book will just not compare.  My perceptions of it as a separate entity from the movie are completely skewed, so I don't know where it fits.  Anyway.  Survivor was really good, especially chapter one (which happens at the very end, sort of Memento like but not really, because it feels like a countdown this way) which made it all work for me by doing exactly what I wanted it to.  Thanks Sean.
