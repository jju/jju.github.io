I got to play host for the first time in China today.  There's a student from Minnesota who's studying the dam and she's going to stay at our college's guesthouse for a couple of weeks.  She knows Chinese, because she, you know, studied it for more than three weeks.  So there's someone around to hang out with and who also thinks the best part of Coffee and Cigarettes was the Tom Waits bit.  
  
Good times.
