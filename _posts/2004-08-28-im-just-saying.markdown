It's been done before and will be done again, but this story in [The Globe and Mail](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040827/BLACK27/TPEntertainment/TopStories) talks about Conrad Black in terms of Citizen Kane references.  It's about a new documentary (Citizen Black), complete with Rosebud quips.  I have a soft spot for those kinds of things since I did one for the CBC in January.  
  

  
I wonder what kind of music the documentary uses.
