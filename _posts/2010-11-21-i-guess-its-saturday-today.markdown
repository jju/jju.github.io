I think I left the house yesterday. Yes I did. I bought some groceries. And the day before, I'd been to school and off visiting libraries for homework purposes and then to Kerry's for board- and party- gaming. We played Settlers and the endgame got bogged down as it sometimes does. I skipped out on Dominion because I was recuperating from Settlers, where I'd made the classic mistake of jumping to a lead too soon and not being able to close it out before getting ganged upon. Selah. I'd been pretty lucky in my early resources.

The rest of the weekend's been homework. I'm almost done the actual Subject Headings part of the last assignment for one of my classes (leaving the essay about the experience still to go). I'm giving a selection of my comics collection subject headings to describe what they're about. I'm not breaking down the series like DMZ or Transmetropolitan into specific volumes and giving them each their own headings. It still got kind of out of hand (I have a lot of fun making lead-in terms). So far I've done it all in a text document without any layout type stuff so I don't have a clue how big it would be on paper and that's probably for the best.

I woke up to snow, which made it a good day to stay inside and work. It's fine when the snow is on the mountains and I can see it up there when the clouds are high enough, but I'm not a big fan of it being here in my part of town. I came to Vancouver for rain and being able to bike to school all winter without ice spikes on my tires. Three days before I bike again.

One of the things I'm looking forward to about China (beyond just being with Holly and eating baked goods and watching movies Holly needs to see and not having assignments that need doing and being a somewhat useful dishwasher for the woman I love) is getting some writing work done. I've been terrible about it this semester. I know that so much of it has to be just sitting down and making the time to do it. Holly'll be working when I'm there, so I'll be filling my time with working too. I did this when I went to visit Nanjing in 2008, all spending my mornings writing while Holly was working. I got a lot done. Hopefully I can repeat myself, at least effort-wise.
