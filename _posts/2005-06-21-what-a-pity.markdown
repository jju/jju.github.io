I've marked my last homework of the year (by which I mean academic year unless I decide to be really slack next semester).  I asked my students to write about what they thought of Wanzhou's new McDonald's.

Most talked about the unhealthiness (which is cool because it gives me an excuse to talk about Supersize Me) and the expensiveness of eating there, which explained why they hadn't done it yet.  Some said it was cheap, but I think they were conflating my mentions of how it is in America with its role here.  At least three students talked about how it was a good location for a romantic meal.  Which made me laugh.  And of course some people just made stuff up involving pizza and chicken legs.  The drumsticks may actually exist, but I wouldn't know since my last McD's trip was back in Hong Kong.

I'd thought I'd be going for sundaes and stuff once it opened, but like a lot of things, I can't get jazzed about going to McDonald's by myself.  I know I don't need to go to McDonald's and if it's not with someone then there's not even that social aspect in there.  It always seems like a good idea to go get some ice cream when I'm in Nanchong with my friends but by myself the idea just sort of gets shy and wilts.
