It bugs me that it bugs me so much how the new pingouink isn't up yet.  And by new I mean yesterday's.  It also bothers me today's isn't up yet.  They're both done done.  Sitting quietly on my hard drive awaiting the time I regain access to the tools that allow them onto your computer screens to bathe you in its pixelly glow.  This just goes to teach me a lesson.  Not only will I work ahead, I will upload ahaead.
