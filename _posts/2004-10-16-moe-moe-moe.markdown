Last night I got to do one of my favourite things, and one of my least favourite.  Guess which was which.  
  
There was a "Welcome Party" for the freshmen.  It consisted of a lot of karaoke style singing, some comedy, a bunch of androgynously smiling limber dancers and a lot of China Mobile ads.  Why are the MCs for these things always the biggest tools that they can find?  I mean, I was sitting way at the back so I could sneak out but even I could see the painted on eyebrows and gigantic fake smiles and patter, no matter what language it was in.  I did end up leaving early because I was really hungry.  I was glad I'd insisted on not sitting up at the front with the other distinguished guests.  
  
I was really hungry because there's a book sale on campus and I'd been on my way to eat when I found it.  And, amazingly enough, there were books I recognized!  They were side by side translations of some classics into Chinese, which was really cool.  And Hillary Clinton's biography and books on Jewish scientists and bankers.  Also there were a couple of illustrated books by this Taiwanese (I think) writer/illustrator that I'm going to work on translating as part of my studying.  It was great walking out of a place having spent just over $10(CDN) on a stack of books.    
  
I'm such a consumeristic stooge.
