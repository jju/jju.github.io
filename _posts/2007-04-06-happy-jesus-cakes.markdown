[A seasonal message from Jeffrey Rowland:](http://www.overcompensating.com/posts/20070406.html)

<blockquote>Remember, you are required to enjoy your Easter Holiday or else Baby Jesus will appear in the night and claw at your eyes. This is not a situation any number of dentists could possibly approve of, regardless of their scruples.</blockquote>

And with that, I'm off to some lake where I hopefully will not be forced into eye-gouging combat with members of the Unrau family.  Hopeful or not, I'm seriously prepared.  Back on Monday.
