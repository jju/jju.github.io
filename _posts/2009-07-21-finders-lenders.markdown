I worked at Reader Services yesterday so it was nice and relaxing. Except for one incident. I was trying to look up the Time Traveller's Wife for a patron and couldn't find it. I tried Time Traveller hyphenated, as separate words, as all one word, with every letter shifted over one in the alphabet (Ujne Usbwfmmfs), everything. Nothing came up though I know we have it. It's very popular. Then, after misspelling Niffenegger a half dozen different ways, I found the title. With only one "L." I shook my fist at the sky and let out a thunderous yell. Almost foiled by American spellings, my wrath was mighty. Then I placed a hold for it (the 219th in line) and went on with my day.

There was another guy who wanted a book by the Crime Writers of Canada from 1984. We didn't have it but I found other Canadian crime novels instead. He was incredulous that we don't have every book ever made in Canada. 

And there was a woman who came to the desk and asked "If it says 'More books by this Author...' on the computer and you use your mouse to click on it and it shows the name does that mean people wrote a book about the person's name?" I explained that it meant that the same person had written more than one book. "Oh," she said taking in this grand revelation.

Then she asks "Where are the bees?"

"You mean books on bees?" She stares with the understanding of a can of paint yet to be spread on a wall. "The insects?" I prod.

She tenses up. "The Bs. B B B!" She draws a capital B in the air with her just barely crooked finger.

"Oh, you mean the B call numbers. B for biography. They're up on the second floor."

By that time her eyes were bulging from their sockets and she tottered over to the elevator without saying goodbye. If she hadn't spoken I wouldn't have thought she was mentally unbalanced at all. Since she did, well...

The wheelchair-bound "Poems on the Spot" guy was in using our stapler with a lot of furtive glowering. And when I took the bus to my mom's for dinner beard lady was on board and talking to whoever would listen as she went to the university to pay her $60 for her insane ad in the Manitoban decrying the university for not having a dermatology or rhinology department.

It was a busy day.
