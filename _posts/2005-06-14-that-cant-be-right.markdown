My mom is trying to tell me that it's 38 degrees Celsius here these days.  She checks the inter tron to find out all that stuff that I forget about.  If that's true (and really, who believes anything they read on the internet?) wow, it's pretty hot!  
  

  
You'd think I'd be complaining about it in a similar way to how I complained about the cold in the winter.  And then you'd be able to chuckle knowingly at how forgetful humans are.
  

  
Well, nuts to you.  
  

  
I remember wishing for heat and am enjoying what we've got these days.  I'd have only guessed the temperatures were about 26, but whatever, it's not like I check these things. I live by instinct, not by numbers. I find answers, not facts.  And I haven't turned on my A/C yet, so really.
