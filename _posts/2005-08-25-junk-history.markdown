I just finished reading a book that English Rob traded to me the last time I saw him.  It's called [1421: The Year China Discovered the World](http://www.1421.tv).  The thesis is that all the European explorers (Da Gama, Magellan, Columbus et al) were using maps that had been created by the Ming dynasty treasure fleets.  The book states that these huge fleets circumnavigated the world and figured out longitude and propagated all sorts of flora/fauna and set up colonies in the Americas.  
  
It's really neat to read, especially as a gamer who needs inspiration for adventures.  But is it true?  
  
I'd understood from Rob when he lent it to me that it was a novel, an alternate history kind of thing.  Sort of a Foucault's Pendulum or Baudolino type deal.  Sadly, it's not.  He's trying to be taken seriously as a popularizing historian, so it was a lot more annoying.  
  
I'm not saying the book is filled with lies - leave that to the debunkers - but it's his whole "I'm just some guy who happened to stumble upon this amazing history changing thing" pose that irks me.  I like the idea that everything we know is wrong, and am sympathetic to alternatives, but either critically examined alternatives or completely fanciful ones.  With sentences like "The new evidence to be revealed in the forthcoming paperback edition in October 2003 is the most explosive yet, and will surely leave no doubts as to the veracity of 1421�s claims" (from the [1421 website](http://www.1421.tv/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=38)) Menzies comes across like he's selling his theory with Tony Robbins.  
  
Then of course you get into the historians who take issue with him, and some of them are even worse.  The [first site](http://www.hallofmaat.com/1421.html) I read was looking at some of his errors (especially the Bimini road theory) which were then taken to mean that the whole book needed to be thrown out.  Fair enough but there seemed to be some things that might work, even if the stone carvings Menzies says are Chinese markers were made during the Bronze Age.  
  
A much more hysterical site was [thediscoveryofamericabychineseis1424isabiglie](http://www.apol.net/dightonrock/thediscoveryofamericabychineseis.htm) (sic).  A quote: 

<blockquote>"[Menzies] says that the commanders of the Chinese fleet were all eunuchs!  The treacherous oceans always demand sailors with big and black testicles, not castrated individuals."</blockquote>

See, this is a shame because earlier on the site the writer had some really good stuff about how Menzies reoriented his maps and fudged latitudes to say things were Puerto Rico instead of Newfoundland.  
  
Anyway, I do know a bunch more about cartography now, and it's a good brushup on the critical thinking skills.  I'd recommend this book to people as long as they don't take it too seriously.
