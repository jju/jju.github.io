I arrived home from work at about four oclock thinking that in at least one alternative universe today would have been a spectacularly good day.  This was not that universe.  As I was coming in the front door, the smoke detector was blaring, not from smoke in the condo but from water pouring through the smoke detector into a large sodden patch of carpet.  Our laundry room was under an inch of water.  My mother's dog and my cat were cowering in my mother's bedroom from the stupidly loud buzzing to warn us of possible fire.  By eight thirty we had furniture away from the walls but in a livable way, and the first Insurance adjuster had come through, and the guy who sucks water out of carpets (and asserts that chicks dig guys who can cook Thai [no, he wasn't Egyptian]), and the upstairs neighbours whose hot water tank busted and whose condo had no damage because all the water conveniently escaped downstairs to us.  The underlay from the carpet has been taken out and we've got giant fans blowing through the carpet till Friday morning.  Excitement all around.
