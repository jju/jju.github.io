That's what the crazy beard lady was shouting at people on the second floor just before close tonight. Shouting before going on at length how that's the only holiday she celebrates.

This morning I discovered I'd bought my mom five yellow roses in a neat little vase for Mother's Day, and then I made her the best omelette I think I've ever had the good fortune of creating. It's no pork wellington, but was still very tasty.

Yesterday was Reyn's non-stag party (non- because he's already married). We went paintballing which involved a lot of waiting around and then a good amount of shooting people. I didn't get hit in the face, which I'd been dreading. Once in the top of the head. Then there was drinking and reliving past times.

And that was my weekend.
