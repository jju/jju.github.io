Helen (the woman herself!) wrote her makeup makeup exam this afternoon and she has now passed the course.  Yes, that is due in large part to our English department assistant (named Adi) forgetting to include the article for the long answer portion, but it's done.  She got a 72 on the shortened exam and a 61 in the course.  Yay her.
  

  
It was so tedious supervising this exam because she sat there for a good 40 minutes just looking at the paper.  Not changing anything, just staring.  I kept on wanting to tell her that she was going to pass no matter what because I didn't want to have to do this again, damnit!
