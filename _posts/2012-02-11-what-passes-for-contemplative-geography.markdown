One of my profs is in Toronto for the iConference this week (where people from the iSchools get together and do informationy kinds of things) so I didn't have to go to my normal 8am class today, which I appreciated, but it's making me feel like school is entirely an illusion. And since that means [unlike every other library school student in the history of the world apparently](http://hacklibschool.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/its-ok-to-not-have-time/), I have lots of free time (still being unemployed) I got a good pile of stuff done the last couple of days (most of it very boring, like [catching up on my book reviews](http://librarianaut.com)).

This afternoon though, I went walking up the seawall and looked at the cargo ships sitting out in the Burrard Inlet (or Salish Sea or possibly all the way out to the Strait of Georgia). I like being able to do that. It's some sort of connection to the world in terms of physical objects that'll be crossing the ocean and I get to see them as they leave. I guess a lot of them just have oil or some other planet-killing thing in them. Or they're just going down to Seattle and not on a real voyage at all. But still.

Another thing I love here is how the mix of hills and water give you great views of the city. When I bike home from school I get to fly down the terrible hill I've fought my way up already once that day, and there's this gap created by English Bay that lets me see all the lights of downtown, and up in North Vancouver and way out east. I don't have to pedal and I can just look at the city as I speed down into it again (well, into Kits, but close enough). And then when I'm climbing up over the Burrard Bridge you feel right in and above all the lights. It's these bits of perspective before getting swallowed up in the urban canyons that I love.

I don't know if I'm staying in Vancouver past my degree's end, but if I leave these are things I'll miss.
