A few nights ago at work I found a disc from [The Hour's Disc Drop](http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/blog/drop.html) endeavour. The idea is that people make mix CDs and then leave them places to spread them around like the flu. Evidently the one I found started at Stradrbook and Osborne or something. It's an okay disc with muy funky grooves at the beginning but then gets all electro-dancey at the end and I stop paying attention.

So yes, the title for this post is a bit inaccurate. Or maybe a little too accurate. I don't know.

I'm impressed with how the disc-dropper managed to leave it in the (often smelly) New & Noted area in the middle of a table after cleanup. The only person I saw around there was a big balding bearded guy (who always reminds me of [Warren Ellis](http://warrenellis.com) but in a more homeless kind of way). I don't think he left it but he saw me pick it up. Maybe he thinks I'm part of a horribly unprofessional spy network, doing our dead-drops out in the open.
