So Chris is moving out at the end of July.  He's been a greta roommate because he's barely ever around and does not forestall our fun shit by his mere presence.  Chris, you and your rent cheque will be missed.

It is nice for me because then I get to move out of the basement and into his room, but it also means we're in need of a new roommate at 425 Beverley.  If you know anyone who'd be interested send Alison an email at alison[dot]froese[at]gmail[dot]com .  Thank you.
