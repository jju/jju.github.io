Most of the pictures are up in [my Flickr photostream](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/) now, so feel free to go look. There are more on my hard drive but I tend to take a few different versions of the same thing so I kept those down in my public portfolio. Interestingly enough I've done some (very rough) geotagging on all my pics, so you can kind of see where they were taken on [my map](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/map/). For lots of them I'm not real specific (all the Jiangyou shots are bunched in one place) since the China maps leave a lot to be desired and the satellite photos don't give me enough information and the map and the satellite don't quite match up as well as they should. I thought since Yahoo sells out dissidents to the Chinese government fairly regularly, they'd be able to get some India style maps out of them.

I worked the checkout desk for a while tonight, and replaced paper towels in the fourth floor washroom because security isn't allowed to touch anything resembling library property. Also got my vacation request form and I have enough hours accumulated to book off as unpaid vacation for the redwoods trip in September.
