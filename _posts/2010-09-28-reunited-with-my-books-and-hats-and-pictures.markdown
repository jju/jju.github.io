So the [really fragile piece of art Lynette did for me with my Chinese miner postcards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/4095327219/) got damaged in the move. It was kind of inevitable really. All that plaster, and only bubble-wrap as protection. It's one of these things that got damaged taking it to Westgate from my old apartment, so I kind of expected bad things to happen crossing half the country. Three chunks came off, and two of them are findable. I might be able to do some restoration work on it and get it displayable. I have plaster and paint and glue. Or I might do something with the wounds themselves. I'm not sure.

I've had a good weekend. I'm pretty much caught up on school so I can go to Winnipeg for Sean's wedding this weekend without having to bring too much work along with me. I skyped with Holly. I read a book. I went to [Word on the Street](http://www.thewordonthestreet.ca/wots/vancouver). I wrote a letter. I made a [blog](http://lwbubc.tumblr.com/) for our [SLAIS student chapter of Librarians Without Borders](http://www.slais.ubc.ca/people/students/student-groups/lwb/index.htm). I drank beers and [toured Special Libraries](http://librarianaut.com/2010/09/27/vancouver-special-libraries-tour/) (not in that order).
