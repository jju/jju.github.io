I'm done my marking.  I completely understand why profs in North America use TAs or robots to do their marking for them.  I could use a TA robot.  
  

  
These exams were heavy on the multiple choice so I could do the marking quick and be out of here before the weekend, and I'd completely get into a trance of checkmarking and x-ing things.  
  

  
The class that I always feel sorry for because they had to have my first crack at all the horribly failed lesson plans got their exams marked first, when I was probably in my state where I stopped and said "What the fuck am I doing?" the fewest times, so I hope that makes up for the crap I put them through.
  

  
The two best lines from the exams (both are from the long answer section in which the students were asked to respond to this old article about Timothy McVeigh): 

<blockquote>"I am full of pain.  I'm afraid I can't agree with it.  However, I hope peace will be everlasting."</blockquote>

This is kind of a classic non-answer for Chinese students, I think.  "I don't know what it's talking about.  Peace is good.  I'll wish for peace.  You can't dock me marks for talking about how nice peace is."  Actually, I can.

<blockquote>"What's more, from the McVeigh's academic records, a mystical leg and his sister, he is not the bomber."</blockquote>

 The second one was part of a bigger answer that got full marks, because (believe it or not) that makes perfect sense with the article I had them read.  And it made me laugh, so it's all good.
