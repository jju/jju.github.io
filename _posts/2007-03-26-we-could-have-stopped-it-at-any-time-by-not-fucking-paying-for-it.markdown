[Click Opera](http://imomus.livejournal.com/) has to be one fo my favourite things to read these days.  [This entry on a hub and spoke world](http://imomus.livejournal.com/273386.html) isn't actually one of the best I've read in the past few weeks, but it's good enough for me.

<blockquote>"A few decades ago," says the Turning Point Project, "it was still possible to leave home and go somewhere else: the architecture was different, the landscape was different, the language, lifestyle, dress, and values were different. That was a time when we could speak of cultural diversity. But with economic globalization, diversity is fast disappearing. The goal of the global economy is that all countries should be homogenized. When global hotel chains advertise to tourists that all their rooms in every city of the world are identical, they don't mention that the cities are becoming identical too: cars, noise, smog, corporate high-rises, violence, fast food, McDonalds, Nikes, Levis, Barbie Dolls, American TV and film. What's the point of leaving home?"</blockquote>

That's from someone he's quoting, isn't new or revolutionary, and echoes one of my favourite Transmetropolitan bits.
