We were drinking hooch at this hotpot restaurant tonight.  The "wine" was brewed by the people here, said one of the people I was with.  "Well I'm sure not to go blind then" I said.  The two of us were drinking with our meal for a while and then the owner came over with another bottle and had to toast me.  Three shots bam bam bam of the definitely more powerful stuff than what he just sells to shmucks.

Someday I'll return to Canada and I'll be out with the guys one night and I will think I can handle the rye train.  And when that train crashes and I am scalded to death by the steam, it will be the fault of all the Chinamen I've drank with.

In Canada I don't do 6 shots in ten minutes (yes I know scream pansy all you want but it's true).  Here, that happens without any real effect, and I'm going to be idiot enough to think that'll cross continents.

It's not just weaker alcohol's fault either.  It's the fact that the Chinese guys are seeming drunk and you're not so you think you're actually a secret tough guy who's been fooling everyone back home.

It'll hurt so bad some day.  But not tonight.
