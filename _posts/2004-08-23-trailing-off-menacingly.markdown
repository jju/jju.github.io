My second class went better than my first.  Since I teach the same things to four different classes, I'd hope that would happen.  Main problem is the whole slowing down while maintaining energy.  Anyone who's seen me speak publicly knows that I kind of bounce around a lot, physically and idea-wise.  That doesn't lend itself well to a class of students who have a tough enough time following English that isn't flowing at a million miles a minute.  And then my speech patterns aren't exactly standard.  But I don't want to just be a bunch of dead weight at the front of the class, which is what it feels like when I do slow down (which students in my first class this morning asked me to do).  So we'll see how that goes.
  

  
I keep on meeting non-English students who want to hang out.  A guy named Alex is going to come by tomorrow at lunch.  He's a tourism student and knows the other foreigners living in Wanzhou.  There's another Canadian downtown.  Stupid small world.
  

  
And then there's Hether (sic).  She showed up at my door last night looking for the previous teacher who lived here (and left in February).  Then she came in and we talked for a bit but I had to get back to planning my classes.  She's an art student and wants to practice her English, but frankly she weirds me out a bit.  Prime stalker material in my books.  She came by again tonight bearing food (and beer) and though I said I'd already eaten and had a lot of work to do she came in and left the food (and beer), which I ate.  It does not appear to have been laced with anything.
  

  
I've got an idea that I'm going to pitch to DNTO as soon as I get a bit better handle on my classes.  No I won't tell you what it is, you idea stealing internet thieves.  When I get my hands on you . . .
