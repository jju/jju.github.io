My friend Holly commented on this CS Lewis passage in an email today: 

<blockquote>The other, and less bad, vices come from the devil working on us through our animal nature.  But [Pride] does not come through our animal nature at all.  It comes direct from Hell.  It is purely spiritual: consequently it is far more subtle and deadly.  For the same reason, Pride can often be used to beat down the simpler vices. Teachers, in fact, often appeal to a boy's Pride, or as they call it, his self-respect, to make him behave decently: many a man has overcome cowardice, or lust, or ill-temper by learning to think that they are beneath his dignity that is, by Pride.  The devil laughs.  He is perfectly content to see you becoming chaste and brave and self-controlled provided, all the time, he is setting up in you the Dictatorship of Pride just as he would be quite content to see your chilblains cured if he was allowed, in return, to give you cancer.  For Pride is spiritual cancer: it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense.   
- From Mere Christianity by CS Lewis</blockquote>

Now I've had my run-ins with Mr. Lewis before (Picture a six-year-old who's just been told that this really neat fantasy book he read was really all about Jesus. Now picture him saying, "Jesus again? That guy's like Ben Affleck 17 years from now.  Fucking guy."  Now picture him wearing a World War 2 helmet and chomping on a cigar when he says it.  And he's a rabbit.) but this correlates with some things I've thought about.  
  
I'm not saying that I agree with this (and I certainly wouldn't talk about something being from the devil) but pride as spiritual cancer does make a bit of sense.  The problem is that I can't talk about the essentialness of pride and self-respect in a way that someone who took this as gospel wouldn't be able to pull apart using the premises laid out there.  To really talk about this you need to talk about excess and moderation.  
  
Man, why don't we have a copy of Lost Horizon in our library here?
