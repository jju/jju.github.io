I'm supposed to give a lecture about anything I want for the school.  I've decided to talk about Art and Hockey in Canadian culture.  Don't worry: it won't be nearly as pretentious as it sounds.  It's basically an excuse to talk about how our $5 bill has a bit from The Hockey Sweater story on it, and to read the first verse of The Hip's Fireworks as if it were a poem.  Of course, Stompin' Tom might make an appearance as well.  It's going to be great.  I'll wear my toque and everything.
