9
  

  
Back from the states now.  Good times had by all.  Wandering St. Paul, watching people eat far too many jalapenos or drink far too much Schlitz, dinosaur bones, some excellent tubing that included a couple of criminals for a time, oh and maybe seeing Cake live (along with Dela Soul (being a sweet hiphop experience) and the Hackensaw Boys (bluegrass from Virginia, god bless 'em)) might be among some highlights.  Short version of one story:  This weekend marked my final wearing of a necktie.  Ever.  I've taken a solemn vow to enhance story potential for the future.  From now on, if anyone asks me why I'm not wearing a tie I will explain how I traded my Spiderman tie for a Cake Tshirt, and thus symbolically traded all ties, indeed the very concept of tie-ness, for all tshirts as a conceptual category.  Oh, the story about Hassie being a dumbfuck moron is really quite good, but I'm not going to tell it here.  It was all good.
