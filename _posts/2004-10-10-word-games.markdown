Whenever I meet students outside of class they always ask, "What do you do with your spare time?"  They are always boggled by the fact that someone can enjoy reading or just going out and seeing what's happening.  Or go shopping without anyone else.  
  
So today would have been especially boggling.  I read and I chopped up newspapers for my classes and then read various books.  I'm having trouble really sinking into 100 Years of Solitude the way I think it deserves to be sunk into.  It's good and fantastical in that kind of Salman Rushdie sense, but I have no problem putting it down to go to bed or to do some work.  I've also got a Jack Kerouac book that's bugging me from its spot on my shelf as next book.    
  
Did I mention that I finished War & Peace a while back?  It was my third or fourth attempt and it took me a little over three months but it's done.  And now I lent it to Holly, who I hope doesn't take as many false starts on it as me.  
  
Margie seems a bit disgruntled about my book situation sometimes.  I mean, she's been here for quite a while and she's down to thirteen books that she hasn't read.  I've been here for seven weeks and haven't had to read all the crap that she's gone through and people seem sensitive to my hardships, sending me books and such (thanks Crackeyes!).  It's just hard to explain that this is such deprivation compared to what I'm used to.  Like, if I were home and had the kind of income I have here I'd be getting a book a week at least, plus shwacks of comics.  Anyway, thank you to people who have sent (and will send in the future) books.  I really appreciate them.  As you may remember.
