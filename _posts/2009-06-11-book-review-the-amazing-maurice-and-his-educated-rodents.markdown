[The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents](http://www.amazon.ca/Amazing-Maurice-His-Educated-Rodents/dp/0552546933/) is the first Terry Pratchett book I've read in quite a while. It's a kids' book but since with Pratchett they all could be kids books, the main indicator is length. It's a short one dealing with rats and Pied Piper stories and actually thinking instead of just using your instincts (even though they would be much easier to deal with). It was a good little story including the girl who thought of herself as being in a story and kept having to be reminded that life isn't like a story, until it was. Thank you Steve, for the birthday present.
