Okay, so Xinjiang is officially excellent.  
  
I got to Nanchong on Friday and had a nice Canada Day watching Chinese movies, eating pasta salad and marking exams late into the night so we'd be able to leave on Saturday.  
  
Saturday we got on the road somewhat late for reasons that will remain unspecified.  But we took the bus to Chengdu (instead of anything I said about our plans) and got in by about 3pm but then got off the 301 at the wrong spot and had to do a bunch of walking in the rain to get to a place to buy tickets.  Travel agent.  That's what they're called.    
  
We got there about 4pm and asked about getting to Urumqi he gave us train info and plane info, but that was going to be kind of sketchy until we gave him a date.  We said, "What about tonight?"  He got on the phone and said there'd be a 30% discount but it left at 8pm.  We said okay and he gave a magnificent "Really?"  But we had to wait a couple fo hours for the tickets so we went for delicious Thai food.  
  
Waiting became Saturday's big theme.  Once we had our tickets and got to the airport (Chinese airlines don't seem to e-ticket yet) we were an hour early, just like we're supposed to be.  It was still raining.  And by raining I mean old men were sawing logs.  Every flight was delayed starting about when we got there.  I didn't realize rain was too much for airplanes (though I appreciate them not risking our lives if the planes would be unable to take off).  We left about three and a half hours late and got into Urumqi at 3 or 4 am.
