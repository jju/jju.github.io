I realize that I'm not the music innovator bleeding-edge person among my friends.  I'm a follow-alonger.  Other people influence so much of my musical tastes that it's silly for me to try and recommend something to anyone.  But if you haven't listened to The Kleptones [A Night at the Hip-Hopera](http://waxy.org/random/audio/kleptones_opera/) you have to.    
  
It's one of these remix album things like DJ Dangermouse's Grey Album (where he took Jay-Z's Black Album and remixed all the tracks with samples from the Beatles'  White Album).  This one uses all sorts of artists remixed with Queen.  Some old school hiphop.  De La Soul is used in a bunch of tracks, there's dialogue from The Big Lebowski, Beastie Boys, Grandmaster Flash, David Bowie, Ferris Bueller, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Busta Rhymes.  The track Bite uses Another One Bites the Dust with ODB's Got Your Money.  So good.  I now expect this track to be on every mix tape that Sean ever makes.
