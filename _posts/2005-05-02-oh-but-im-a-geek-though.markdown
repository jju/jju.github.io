And the other part of the media blitz is up today too.  If you are interested, I invite you to take a look at RPG.net where the introduction to my new column [The Gamer's Guide to Hitch Hiking](http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/g2h202may05.html) is up.  
  
It's going to be a look at how travel influences the gaming process.  We'll see how well it's received in the forums below the article.  It's an idea that I've been kicking around for years.  I think it was somewhere in the middle of our Lazy-man trek when Reyn and I were wishing Lopez's quest for zip-lines had come to fruition that I first started thinking about it.  I had to think about something to keep my mind off my burning quads.  
  
Another part of this G2H2 thing that I'd like to do someday is put together a series of travel articles for gamers.  Like where to go in NZ to find places featured in the Lord of the Rings, or the best actual dungeons in the world. Stuff like that.  That's outside the scope of the column but it's something I'm kicking around as a future project.  
  
The G2H2 thing is interesting because I put a bit more time into each column than I do into a blog post, and there's a fairly vocal audience at RPGnet that'll give feedback.  Often it'll be along the lines of "This is such a waste of time!" but some columnists get kudos as well.  I'm interested to see how these go.  I've got three written and submitted and a whole pipeline ready to go but I didn't want to get too far ahead of myself.
