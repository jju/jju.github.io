One of my many bosses is in town today.  I tried to explain her position to my mom but found it was utterly impossible.  The different organizations I am a part of keep their labyrinths nice and internecine.  Someday I fully expect to find out that I'm actually working for a minotaur.  Possibly a cyborged up minotaur.  Stapled to a shark.
  

  
Before she (who is neither a minotaur nor any other sort of mythical beast) got here I had class to teach and a cryptic package to receive.  Today we covered all of American literature (and film!) in two 40 minute chunks.  These last two culture classes have been basically just me tossing way more information at them than they could possibly absorb.  We'll see how much of it stuck some day.
  

  
And if you've forgotten what it's like to hear me whine about how I don't know how teach people to read extensively, well, I can't help you today.  Search the archives or something.  This isn't because I've suddenly had some revelation on how to teach this bullshit; I'm just tired of complaining about it.  It sucks lots and every Tuesday morning I contemplate various scenarios that would end with me arriving bloodied and dishevelled and cancelling classes due to "circumstances beyond my control."
  

  
But I'd probably have to make them up on a Saturday.
