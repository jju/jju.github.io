The Great Wall is very long and there are many places a person can go see it.  The most famous is Badaling, close to Beijing.  Another place close to Beijing is Mutianyu, which is where I went yesterday with our group.  Traffic was slow, lineups were long, and the vendors trying to sell "I Climbed the Great Wall" TShirts at the bottom where you couldn't even see it properly were thick.

First you climb up to the Wall.  Or you don't.  There's a cable car and a chairlift that also ferry people up (and a toboggan run to slide them down).  The climb, if you choose to take it, is about fifteen minutes but it's pretty steep with a goodly number of stairs.

Then you're up on the Wall in all its ancient glory.  Or you're not.  The touristy section of the wall was restored heavily in the last thirty years, so you aren't actually walking along anything all that ancient (although the 70s were a long time ago).  But it's still pretty neat.

You climb up into watchtowers and survey the wall as it winds up and down the surrounding ridges and feel the loneliness that a sodlier guarding it would have felt deep in his soul.  Or you don't.  I was lucky and got almost 5 minutes alone on the top of one of these towers, but for the most part there were packs of tourists everywhere, including a bewildering mob of yellow shirted school kids led by megaphones.  Not people, just megaphones.

Then you reach the last restored tower that tourists are allowed into so you stop and go back.  Or you don't.  After this last tower the old wall stretches out in two perpendicular directions, and there are signs saying "Pleqse do not to go further."  Yes that's supposed to be a q.  It's silent.  As in fox.  Anyway, I recruited Seth, a 12 year old kid from our group to go hike our way along one of these sections of wild wall.  So we left and hacked through brush, fighting off big hairy flying bugs and finding crumbled guardhouses and abandoned cisterns, hopping over crumbled sections of wall, and wondering about the double crenellations of the Mutianyu wall.  Finally we stopped and had a bit of a snack.  We could see where the rest of the tourists had stopped and we waved, enjoying our space.  It was excellent.  The first time on this trip I'd really felt like I was travelling.  Good times.
