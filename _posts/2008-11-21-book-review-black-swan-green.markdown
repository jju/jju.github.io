[Black Swan Green](http://www.amazon.ca/Black-Swan-Green-David-Mitchell/dp/067697497X/) by David Mitchell is a book about a 13-year-old in 1982 England. The book is a collection of short stories that build up to a novel. It's not weird at all, doesn't overly sentimentalize childhood and is generally excellent.
