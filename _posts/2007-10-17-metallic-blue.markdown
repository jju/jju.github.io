My iPod shuffle finally ran down its battery yesterday after something like two weeks of using it on every trip to work and back. That is a suitable amount of music time. Thanks mom!

Just to be clear about that last post, I'm not mortally depressed about not doing anything cool right now. Just irked. And I realize that most people aren't doing anything cool but in my head I'm not in competition with "most people," just some idealized version of myself. Ah the perils of being an only child.
