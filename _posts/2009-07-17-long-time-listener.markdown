I noted this one on [vagabondscrawl](http://vagabondscrawl.tumblr.com/) but have decided to make reference here too: [Long Time Listener](http://catandgirl.com/?p=2115), a Cat and Girl comic that is true. I especially like how the radio speaks back to her when Girl goes "Augh!" Sadly my radio doesn't do that frequently enough.
