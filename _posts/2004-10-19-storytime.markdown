So here's the deal.  I'd decided to go out for a walk and buy an iced tea.  It was sunny and pretty out.  I take my camera and snap a few shots.  Then I head out the main gate and am stopped by two skinny guys in uniforms.  They won't let me or any other students out the gate.  They speak no English.

I have my camera along so I start taking some pictures.  They don't seem to mind.  Some teachers are escaping, so I try telling the guards "Wo shi Yingyu laoshi."  It doesn't matter.  I decide to hang around until a student from the English department tries to leave so she can help me.  That's exactly what happens after a while (and after a funny scene where a tiny ancient woman wouldn't take no for an answer).

Clover (not one of my students) explained to them that I wasn't a student, but they said it still didn't matter.  There was something going on in town and people weren't allowed to leave the college.  I said that wasn't a big problem and headed back to my apartment, where I grabbed my videocamera, left a quick blog post in case something happened and made my break.

I went out a different road through the school and no one challenged me.  It was disappointingly easy to leave.  So I took some video from outside the gate of students being turned back (basically to be an ass to the guards).

Then I started wondering what it was that the students were being confined for.  I finished my iced tea and got on a bus downtown to see if I could find it.  And find it I did.
