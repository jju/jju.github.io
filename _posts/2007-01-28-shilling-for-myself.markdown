Would you like for me to be paid for writing, but don't feel like giving me any money yourself?  Here is a way!  I entered a microstory in the West Central Streets writing contest and now it's been published and is up for voting.  Read this little scene called Hungry.  If you like it, email erika.wiebe@gov.mb.ca to say you think it should win the Adult Story competition.  Only one vote per person please.  Thank you.  
  


<blockquote>Hungry - J Jack Unrau  
  
Hunger can strike at the most inopportune times.  Once, I was far from home, indulging in a wonderfully lonely 4 a.m. bike ride, when a paralysing hunger hit me.  I located a late night drive-thru as a means of satisfying my cravings, and found myself staring at a vast outdoor menu.     
  
"Hey there.  What do you recommend?" I was greeted with silence, so I repeated myself.  Still no one answered.  I leaned back from the menu board to see if the restaurant had somehow closed, but no, there were still lights on and my watch told me I had 23 minutes before the closing time.  Try though I might I could see no movement inside the drive-thru's window just beyond the menu.  Was anyone in there watching me?  Several minutes of silence passed while I speculated that perhaps everyone inside was tied up and at the mercy of some marauding fast food burglar.  I thought maybe I should take that into account.   
  
"Hey, if you're in there, all I want is something to eat.  If you could spare a moment from your ultra-quiet hostage taking or whatever's going on and grab me some food that'd be great.  You don't have to cook anything special, anything'll do.  Pull something out of the freezer and throw it under a heat lamp.  I don't really care, just please . . . I'm hungry."  And so I went, pleading with an empty speaker late at night.   
  
It didn't take too long for me to get tired of talking to the unknown void.  I forced myself to move on, but only got as far as the order window.  There, arresting me with its presence, was a grilled chicken sandwich wrapped in foil.  I peered through the window to see who might have brought it out to me, but no one appeared.  I ate the sandwich quickly, glad it had no mayonnaise, then rode off again to enjoy the late summer night's loneliness.</blockquote>

There are other entries but you'd have to get a copy of this hyperlocal paper to see them.  Please do so, but also please vote for me.  
  
I feel so dirty.
