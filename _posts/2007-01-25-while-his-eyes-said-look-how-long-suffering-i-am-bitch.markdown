This is from the show last night.  There's no audio.  Sorry.  It gives a better picture of the man's awesomeness than [the impressionistic picture I took with _my_ phone](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/368339289/).[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCboktgxmzQ]  
  
This morning I had a minor incident with Rachael.  At 10 I went upstairs to get some of the good morning light for painting.  I turned on music to paint to.  Rachael came down to ask me to turn it down.  Actually she turned it down (because I was in the kitchen watching water boil) and then told me she was trying to sleep.  I mentioned it was 10, not 6:30 or anything and she went upstairs.  
  
Forty minutes later she came down again with a long thing about how Wednesdays are her only days to sleep in so I should wait until she wakes up to play music.  I pointed out that I waited till 10 and she said she appreciated that, but I don't think she did.  I think "I appreciate that" is code nurses use when they are trying to patronize someone.  I don't think it works when they actually have no coercive power over their patronizee.  
  
I'm looking forward to when she's got papers or whatever coming up so Alison and I can have a party.
