I read Jason Little's [Shutterbug Follies](http://www.amazon.ca/Shutterbug-Follies-Graphic-Jason-Little/dp/0385503466/) at Intrepid on my second last day's breaks. I like the drawing style, which felt kind of Herge esque and there were some decent characters but overall the story just kind of left me flat. The phototech spies out this guy who may have killed his wife and then does amateur detective work around it. In these kind of Rear Window-esque stories I'm always waiting for another twist, something to make it more than it seems at first glance. This one leaves you going "Oh. Well then." And that's it.
