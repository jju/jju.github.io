One of my favourite books I read in China was Neal Stephenson's [Snow Crash](http://www.amazon.ca/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0553380958/).  Right now, due to McNally Robinson's excellent Bargain Books section, I'm reading his Baroque Cycle and it is enthralling.    
  
I love the idea that 17th Century Natural Philosophers had that they could categorize everything.  I love dealing with that impulse in the Dewey Decimal System at work.  It's fun to try and figure out what a call number means when there's only one example on the shelf.  (I could do a trivial amount of googling for these things if I cared but my way is more fun.)  Example: As far as I can tell, 779.93915 is for Photographs of Hair.  
  
I also like that there's a [Complete Idiot's Guide to Faith](http://www.amazon.ca/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Faith-Moore/dp/1592574947/).
