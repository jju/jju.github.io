I only have one class left to teach!  Word on the street is that next semester I might be teaching another reading course.  I hope so.  Now I have ideas about what kinds to do for it.  Not being stuck with newspapers would be wunderbar.  I definitely won't be teaching newspapers and will be teaching American Culture next term.  Well, as definite as anything here is.  
  
I really hope that I don't have crappy days with three classes again though.  Now it's just a storm of marking to get through.  W00t!
