Tibet kicked my ass in a nonchalant way that only an environment can really pull off.  It was implacable when it's entire 3800m of altitude made me nauseous and shivering and sore.  And I'm pretty sure my "standing around" heartrate shouldn't have been 116bpm.

So I've returned to Wanzhou.  Yes I was defeated by cold and sickness but it was still a very good week.

After my last post I had a stretch of 36 hours in bed to get me back to the point where I could go see things again.

Then I went to the Sera Monastery, which was a lot further away than I'd thought, but had two things that aside from all the other templey monasteryish hey-I'm-in-tibet kind of reasons to go there that I only found through exploring.

The first: A room where they reprint all their sacred texts.  There are two guys sitting on the floor who put ink on a carved stone, slap paper down on the stone, run a flat stone across the paper, flip the paper down to the stack, reink the stone and repeat every 1.5 - 2 seconds.  Surrounding them are millions of pages of these long skinny books in wooden covers.

The second: I saw a freaking sand mandala.  It was about a metre across and the wind quadrant was damaged.  But it was intricate and beautiful and I wouldn't even dare to take a picture since the whole point of these things is their impermanence (though I suspect this one has been sitting around for a while in defiance of doctrine but to satisfy people like me).

I also hung out on the roof of the Jokhang Temple, which is where Tibetan Buddhism began.  They probably started off on the ground though.

But I'm still sick so I hobbled back to Wanzhou to try and recuperate before I head to Hong Kong where it will be warm.  Even here I'm marvelling at how my fingers are just numb instead of in pain  from the temperature.

Gloriously warm in Hong Kong.
