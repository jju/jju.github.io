I'd been a bit worried about my net connection here, but the school provided computer isn't as awful as it could be.  And the sole reason I am saying that rather than cussing my freakin' brains out is because I could get Firefox installed so I can block popups (I hate you Explorer!). 
  

  
As an aside, isn't "cussing" a great word?  In our Chinese classes I'd often break into a stream of mild invective when the language was being obstinate (not me being dumb, oh no; it's all putonghua's fault).  Near the end Holly asked if I thought Tan Laoshi (our teacher) understood all my cussing.  I just giggled because who says cussing?  Apparently people from Virginia do.
  

  
I still will need to connect my computer to the net for doing any serious website updates, but for basic blogging and (non-mass) emailing this is doing fine.
