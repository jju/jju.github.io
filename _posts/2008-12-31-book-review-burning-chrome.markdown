I forgot to mention [Burning Chrome](http://www.amazon.ca/Burning-Chrome-William-Gibson/dp/0060539828/) when I read it a couple of weeks ago. It's a collection of William Gibson short stories. I think it works better than some of those earlier novels. Maybe it's just because he couldn't do his standard three stories intersecting into one thing. There was a Sprawl story in there and one about  a WWI dogfighting video game but my favourites were about an aging Russian trapped in a space station and one about being a music producer for a woman who uploads herself. Oh but the one about the interstellar highway was pretty awesome too. Anyway. Yes. William Gibson. Woo.
