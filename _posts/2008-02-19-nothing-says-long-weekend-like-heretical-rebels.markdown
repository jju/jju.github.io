I like that while other provinces have namby pamby Family Day, Manitoba gets [Louis Riel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel) Day. And on Presidents' Day no less.

I've just been rereading up a storm here. Finished 1984 this morning, and there's a lot less to it than I remember from reading it in grade 12. Now I'm into Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 1972 by the good Doctor. This is a much more interesting read this time (as opposed to 2001 or so the last time I read it) because I've got a better sense of what US primaries are about.

And tonight I'm finally going to see No Country for Old Men. Pretty good day. Maybe I should shoot a man named Scott just to get in the holiday spirit.
