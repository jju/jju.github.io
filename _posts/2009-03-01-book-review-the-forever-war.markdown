Joe Haldeman's [The Forever War](http://www.amazon.ca/Forever-War-Joe-Haldeman/dp/0312536631/) is a classic of science fiction about a soldier drafted in the futuristic time of 1997 and his life in and out of the military. Because of relativistic effects that life lasts a long time. I confess, I read it because of John Scalzi, who wrote the introduction to this new edition and was pimping it on his blog, [Whatever](http://whatever.scalzi.com/). Haldeman wrote it in the 70s after his time in the Vietnam war and I think what I like best about the book is the lack of battles. There's one engagement where they slaughter aliens, one in which they get hit by an attack en route to a battle, and a fight out on some cold rock in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't this one soldier being in the middle of everything important that happened in the war. It was a soldier trying to live his life with a war happening to him. I liked it a lot. He wasn't some war hero, as he never really did much, but he was seen as one for surviving. Yeah, I can see why it was a classic.
