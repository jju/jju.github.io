Today was a sweetass day.  I picked up some comics at the library, bought the new Tom Waits album (which is frickin' sweet and full of good versions of things I'd only had crackly bootlegs of), and am one step closer to having a job.  Next week I'll interview with the city to become a page at the liberry (probably shouldn't make that joke in the interview).  I am very confident in my book sorting abilities, so I think it'll go well.  
  
I celebrated by reading the pile of library comics I got and then eating a couple of tasty minipizzas.
