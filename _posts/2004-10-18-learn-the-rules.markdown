I know I keep on talking about it but I finished Atlas Shrugged this evening.  There's good stuff and infuriating stuff even just from a writing perspective and ignoring all the philosophy. It was weird teaching a class on reading economic news today because I didn't want to get all Randian on them.  So I won't talk about it here any more.  Next up I read Plato's discourse on love in Symposium.

"Yeah, and you also invented homos!"

I went out taking pictures tonight (check [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/) for the proof) and have decided that a tripod and a bigger memory card for my camera are more important than a big coat.
