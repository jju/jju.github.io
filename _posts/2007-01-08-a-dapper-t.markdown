I spoke about China in [Charleswood](http://www.cwoodchurch.org/eng/e_main.php)'s Peace & Justice Sunday School class this morning.  Half an hour to talk about my time with the organization formerly known as CEE (and yes, now that I'm no longer a member of said organization I'm going to refer to it by name, or at least acronym).  I'm scattered at the best of my time and we stopped for coffee on our way to church.  
  
Basically I focused on the "godless communist state aspect" but not in a bad way.  I just talked about a lot of the obliviousness to religion in students my main contacts, and where I did experience something I recognized as belief.  No one told me what to talk about, so I just did my own thing, letting people grab fragments here and there where they could.  
  
Then I watched a lot of football this afternoon.  This NFL thing has become strangely compelling to me.  
  
I also worked out a first page script for this idea Hassie handed me while he was here.  And realized that the other script I thought I'd had worked out for him needs more stuff crammed into it.  I wrote it in a very expansive style, like there were all the pages in the world to get where I eventually want to go.
