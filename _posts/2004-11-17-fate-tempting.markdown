I know I'm lucky to be in China now.  Lucky or ruined.  One of the two.  
  
I'm talking about my connectedness here.  I'm listening to the new Cake album, which came out sometime in October.  Thanks to a DSL line and piracy I'm listening to it now.  And that's awesome.  But I feel really spoiled.    
  
Isn't there supposed to be some hardship for doing what is by some accounts (shh don't tell anyone) missionary work?  I mean, all that stuff is getting blurred right out of existence.  And I'm here right on the edge of it, getting all the benefits with only esoteric penalties like not having anywhere to buy miniatures to paint, or comics (but I can read about all that stuff on the Net, so I'm still somewhat connected to it).  Well, we also don't have a McDonalds here, but I don't count that as a difficulty.    
  
Really the only problem is not having my friends here.  Last week I would have given my left nut and a foot of large intestine to play some Necromunda with Hassie, Steve and Dave (not that the rest of you aren't important, but you probably wouldn't be fun to play Necromunda with (except my gaming friends that actually read this which is probably a very small number)). But that's the same wherever you go.    
  
Anyway, it feels like I'm going to go back to Canada someday and be embarrassed about how little I had to give up to live in China for two years.  Just like I feel when I explain that my MA was one year (twelve months) and didn't require a thesis.  
  
Listening to: **End Of The Movie** from the album Pressure Chief
