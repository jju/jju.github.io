On Friday I demonstrated how I am my mother's son and managed to trip over nothing as I was crossing a street. The traffic was stopped at the light so everyone had a good view of me standing and then hitting the ground. 

Unlike when my mom does these sorts of things I came out of it with only one injury, a knee that does not enjoy bending or being knelt on. It's winter here so I was wearing my protective leathers, otherwise my elbows, shoulder and a good chunk of my back would be scraped all to hell through my dramatic rolling technique I perfected in grade 6 telling violent stories to kindergarteners.

The long-weekend here's been pretty rainy and bleah, so I didn't feel the need to go out putting stress on my tender knee until this morning when I went to wrok and discovered it **is** a long-weekend. I hung out, had coffee and wrote [a book review](http://librarianaut.com/2011/06/13/book-review-for-the-win/) at the office while I waited for it to stop raining. 

I appreciate the fact that we have an espresso machine at work with company coffee so I don't have to spend my own money on caffeination. When Holly arrives (in less than 3 weeks!) she might be bringing her fancy tea ceremony paraphernalia she's been learning about. Which will be pretty cool, but we'll still probably have to start buying coffee.

Possibly next week or the week after I might be sent out to the wilds of Victoria to teach some librarians about using Koha. I've never been on a business trip before, and I get to take the train! We were pricing it out on Friday and it's all "First-Class sleeper" this and "hotel and food money" that, which is much more fun than the ordeal we went through getting Holly flights to Sydney and Vancouver.
