What are cockroach burial practices like?  Are they cannibalistic little coprophages or do they treat their carcasses with special reverence?
  

  
I ask because last night when I woke up to take a piss I stomped one good in my kitchen.  It was dead.  Not moving at all.  I left it there, thinking I'd sweep it up in the morning.
  

  
Come morning, twas gone.  Nothing to sweep.
  

  
I'm sure the tributes the other roaches gave deep in their lair were very touching.  "Crow sure knew how to scuttle away from light."
  

  
How many pallbearers do you think there were?  Would they have brought him down if he'd died by poison?  How deep do cockroaches dig their graves?
