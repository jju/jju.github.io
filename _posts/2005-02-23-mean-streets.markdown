I just witnessed an attempted purse-snatching outside the school.    
  
That is to say I saw a figure next to a middle-aged woman bolt down the street as the started yelling and some other people grabbed this figure.  By the time I got closer they'd been in and out of a little fruit shop and I wasn't sure who the original snatcher was anymore.  
  
One guy grabbed something from the counter to kind of use as a weapon, but a couple of other people took it away from him.  It looked like a large vegetable peeler.  I think this guy was the original snatcher, but I could be wrong.  
  
The odd thing was that while one guy was on his cell phone and yelling at peeler-grabbing-man everyone else around just told PGM to take off.  The victim was with cell phone guy and I assume he was calling police.  All the bystanders (including myself) let PGM, the apparent purse snatcher walk off down the street.  He was yelling at cell phone guy all the while.  
  
Evidently no one made up false credentials to justify a beating this time.  But I have to admit that passed through my head while I stood around watching the exchange.    
  
I also thought about how little it takes to make a place sound dangerous, so no one's allowed to start thinking I'm unsafe or anything.  My cousin went to Jo'Burg for three weeks and was robbed twice, and was in real fear for his life at least once, to hear my mom tell it.  Wanzhou is Steinbach in comparison (without all the wealth, repression and abuse).
