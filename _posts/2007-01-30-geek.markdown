Have you ever played [Wushu](http://wiki.saberpunk.net/Wushu/)?  I'm playing in an online Star Wars Wushu game and it is quite excellent.  A while back Sean had mentioned that he'd like to play an RPG, a first in many years for the DJS5.  Wushu might just be the perfect game for doing this.  It's all about doing cool stuff, which would fit perfectly with my non-RPGing friends.  We could even set it in Hol for old time's sake.
