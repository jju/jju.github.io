Well here's the problem!  I haven't been blogging about what I'm reading.
  

  
Last night I finished Miramar, my third in row by Naguib Mahfouz.  Now, I'm of a mixed mind about footnotes in stories (apart from those by Terry Pratchett, which are some of the best parts of the Discworld books).  I do appreciate the extra information, but I hate it when they're actually endnotes so I have to keep flipping pages.  And usually they aren't that interesting.  I wish that writers of fiction would just put all that information in an introduction to get the sense of things without breaking up the reading experience because you're scared you're missing something crucial.  If you want to know more, that's what the Internet is for.
  

  
Connecting this up with China, the other day [Ning Hua](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/10663353/) came over to complain about the Maclean's magazines I'd lent him.  He's got an English radio show on campus here and wanted multicultural news (and for some reason he won't take notes from the Internet).  So he's trying to read about the sponsorship scandal and Camilla's wedding and Terry Fox and he doesn't get it at all.  
  

  
He showed me the "English magazine" that his friend had, which had explanatory footnotes and really easy vocabulary.  I had to explain that what he had there was a learn to read English textbook masquerading as a magazine.  Real magazines assume people can read the language and aim to stimulate those readers' brains.
  

  
"But aren't they supposed to use easy language?"  And I explained that Maclean's is easy compared to reading a PoliSci paper on the scandals.  It's fairly snappy and conversational.  
  

  
His shoulders slumped and his eyes opened wide "Conversational?  People talk using words like that?"  And because I've been in a bit of a pissy mood lately I said, "Yeah, smart people do."
  

  
So he left with a crushed and dejected spirit, boggled by the hopelessness of learning this stupid language.
