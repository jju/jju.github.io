Kobo Abe's The Box Man is about a man who lives in a box. He is paid to destroy his box and then sits around watching a fake box man and and his nurse/mistress. I don't really have anything to say about this one. I found the voice annoying and confusing. It's impossible to tell who is who and whether the narrator is actually narrating about himself or someone else or what the hell is going on. That's kind of the point, this blending in and blurring of anonymous lines, but when the narrator is dead for a while chunk and you aren't sure whether to take it seriously because you aren't sure if he's talking about himself or the fake version of him, then it's all kind of a mess. I could have just been in entirely the wrong mood for this one.
