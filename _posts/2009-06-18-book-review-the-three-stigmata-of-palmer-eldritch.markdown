In [The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch](http://www.amazon.ca/Three-Stigmata-Palmer-Eldritch/dp/0679736662/) off-world colonists take an illegal drug called Can-D which allows them to experience as collectives the life of Perky Pat and her male companion from an Earth before the  planet began melting. There are also precognitives who make business decisions based on what fashion will be and the movers and shakers undergo evolution therapy which turns them into bubbleheads but every once in a while people slightly devolve instead. Palmer Eldritch may or may not have returned from Proxima Centauri bearing gifts and a bubblehead may have been foreseen to murder a man he's never met. But it might all be in his mind. Or someone else's. Or in the future.

So, a normal Philip K Dick book. And by normal I mean really quite good.
