The other thing I wanted to do was re-explain my reason for thinking about who'd write you.  It's not a matter of having your decisions made for you by some dead Russian dude.  What it is about is getting different perspectives on things.  I find that I think about things in a patterned kind of way, which has gotten me this far in an alright manner.  Sometimes you don't want to think about things the way that you think about things and that's when you reach into your bag of perspective tricks.  Personally, I don't read horoscopes but I do flip tarot cards.  Not in any kind of organized reading or anything, but I'll pick a card (any card) and think about it and how it changes my perspective on things.  Using the character thing just cuts down on the randomness and uselessness of a different perspective.  You already have some sort of identification with how the author writes situations and can say "I could see myself doing things like how this author writes them."  This means that at some level there'll be at least a bit of relevance.  Then when you have some sort of a question, you find a similar situation in the author's work and see what those characters did.  Example:  Justin is written by Haruki Murakami.  Justin is abandoned by the woman he loves (just an easy example because it happens in every Murakami novel).  Justin has gone through the situation in his own head and has found himself stuck in the same three trains of thought.  So he hits the books to see what "other" Murakami characters would do.  He finds a number of different reactions most of which involve bewildered acceptance without making too much of a fuss.  But Justin also finds in the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle that the hero goes down into a well to think.  Hmm. . . Justin hadn't thought of that before, so since he knows his transitive properties he wonders if something like that would work for him.  Whatever he comes up with doesn't matter; it's just a way of thinking about things from a tiny bit outside your own head.
  

  
There.  That'll make up for not posting for a while.
