I did a presentation in class today and was really glad I didn't have anyone as a partner for it.  I could just go through my material with my own editorializing comments and not have to worry about anyone else.  It was also short, which people appreciate in a three hour class of presentations on databases and other infosources.  Especially when all the others go ten to twenty minutes over their allotted time.
  

  
Good thing number 2.  I outlined a five page chunk of the DJS5 origin story comic.  It's simple, but it'll play.  As it stands now, Hungry J is a post-apAustenyptic zombie bzapped into a gateway dimension, where they get assembled.  I need good suggestions on how to draw a (simple!) zombie version of a person.  A not at all realistic person, but one that has nonetheless been undead for a while. Comments appreciated.
