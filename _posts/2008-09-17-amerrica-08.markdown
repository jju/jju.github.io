Sean and I are back from Amerrica (the extra "r" is for redwoods) and I have a pile of writing to do. Until that all gets settled out, here's [the preliminary set of photos on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/sets/72157607110701865/with/2864377648/). They're all geotagged so you can see on [a map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/89816840@N00/sets/72157607110701865/map?&fLat=48.5868&fLon=-113.4493&zl=13&order_by=recent) where we were (roughly) for each of them. There are more pictures but these were the more representative I could find as I combed through the gigs of cards I just dumped onto my hard drive.
