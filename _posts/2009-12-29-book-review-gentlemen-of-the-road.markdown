[Gentlemen of the Road](http://www.librarything.com/work/2849877/54335460) is a Michael Chabon book so obviously it's about Jews. Fun thing about this one is that it's a pretty much straight up adventure tale about Jewish vagabonds in the oh let's say 1100s up the Caspian Sea. In the afterword Chabon talks about how his working title for the book was Jews With Swords, but no one really took that seriously. The story is good adventurey stuff and uses a setting that I haven't read a million billion times, which is good. I don't really have much more to say about it than that. There are plenty of sword fights and horse-thieveries and elephants.
