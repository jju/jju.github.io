This is from a National Review Online article about the [ Arctic National Wildlife Refuge](http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/goldberg200503180758.asp):

<blockquote>The mosquitoes are not fast flyers, but if you stand still they swarm around you like senators spotting a TV camera. The DEET works well, where it works. But since the warning label suggested avoiding my face, the buggers go straight for my nose, mouth, and, most distressingly, the air pockets of my safety goggles. While they are not the size of blue jays, I can't help wondering how so many journalists have scoured the area without mentioning the fact that on a bad day, according to the villagers in nearby Nuisquit, you can't open your mouth for fear of inhaling the mosquitoes.</blockquote>

Okay, I've been thinking in the last little while that I need to read more diverse stuff.  Not just Alternet and GNN, but some different points of view.  Things that I get angry reading so I can try and figure out why it gets me angry.  So this comes out of that.  The National Review Online runs ads about Vile France and wearing Red State baseball hats and gets wildly angry about the damned liberal media.  For real.
  

  
The thing that bugs me is how well some articles appeal to my skeptical side.  Like this article I linked to: I know how shitty mosquitoes are and I can understand how this wildlife refuge isn't the heaven on earth that it's made out to be.  The problem is accepting those facts while maintaining that it's a bad idea to go in and fuck nature up just cause we can.
  

  
It's much easier to remain in echo chambers than to see what people are saying and that they might not be absolute frothing morons, but just people I disagree with.  
  

  
I want to have nothing to do with any political issue ever.
