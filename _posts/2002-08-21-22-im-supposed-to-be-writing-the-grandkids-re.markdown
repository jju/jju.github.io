I'm supposed to be writing the grandkids' remembrances for the funeral right now, but instead I'm thinking about bears.  Bears stealing picnic baskets and bears getting hit by motorcycles up in flin flon and bears that get sucked out in the undertow when they're out on vacation and out on a trip and bears that fish with their massive paws and bears that fish with fishing poles that are hooked into their back pockets and bears that maul little New York girls and bears that survive the next biological holocaust and who let bear drive?
