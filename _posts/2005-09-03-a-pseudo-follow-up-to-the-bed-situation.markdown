I guess Wanzhou just isn't big enough to have [this kind of service](http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=stabhav&tab=weblogs&uid=340214002).  
  
Though it reminds me of my friend Irene and how the last night she and Rob were in town before moving to Chengdu she made a joke about the pink light salons.  Well, it wasn't much of a joke; she just asked if I wanted to go inside, thinking I was a naive Canadian bumpkin.  
  
Now though the lights are pink, not red, it wasn't an Encyclopedia Brown level mystery to figure out what these "salons" that were open at 2am with two or three women in tight dresses hanging around inside were all about.  They'd been a part of my landscape since last September, and I told Irene so.  
  
She was a little surprised that I knew what they were.  Rob and I talked about how the red light district is a fairly international phenomenon (hell, Steveo's old band used it as a name for a while).  But Irene had been told by other Canadian guys that they had no idea what these things were really about when she suggested a visit to them and they said sure.    
  
Personally, I suspect some disingenuousness on the part of those other Canucks.
