My mom came out to fakeLondon for Thanksgiving.  She filled my fridge and met Ludmilla* and stuff.  And now I'm very tired.
  

  
I saw Lost In Translation on Saturday.  Not the [Best. Movie. Ever.](http://www.jackiedirks.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_jackiedirks_archive.html#106558194518992753)  I mean it wasn't bad, but nothing amazing.  Though I loved all the pictures of Tokyo, especially the arcade with the insane drumming games and stuff.
