I can't remember if I've been talking about this already this week but I'm getting really into brainmaps and things.  The idea of them.  Software held in our skulls and combining into some sort of future network of consciousness.  
  
I was at my mom's last night and took a telephone survey about internet usage and movies and stuff.  One of the questions was "How much time do you spend online in a week?"  I had no idea.  It's like asking "How much time do you spend ingesting liquids in a week?"  Who keeps track of these things?  
  
Another question was "What do you use the internet for?" and the guy suggested browsing.  I agreed and said, "Oh yeah, and email obviously, the other communication kinds of things, but that's about it" since I don't do tonnes of p2p downloading anymore.  He asked "Shopping?" Well, yeah, but isn't that the same as browsing?  "Banking?" Yes, but that counted as part of my answer for browsing.  "Research?" What the hell do you think the word browsing means?  It's such a stupid idea to talk about those things as if they're different.  I'm online.  I do things online.  I ride my lightcycle all over the freakin' place.  Gah.
