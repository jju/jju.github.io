I've done an excellent job avoiding the work I should be doing on my seniors' newspaper reading exams by reading journalistic gold like [Jack Ace](http://checkerboardnightmare.com/d/20040721.html).
  

  
Seriously, it was sunny and nice and I couldn't spend my day completely cooped up in my office so I avoided the work I should be doing by reading Kundera books out in the sun.  Nothing could be better than that.
  

  
Except flamethrowers for hands.
