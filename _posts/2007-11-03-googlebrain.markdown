I know some people who are scared of the future. Really. Not just in a "We're living in the end times and Jesus isn't going to take me 'cause I'm not good enough" kind of way either. People to whom a story like [Your Outboard Brain Knows All](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/st_thompson) is deeply terrifying. I don't think I'm one of them.
