So I don't know exactly how most of you get here to read this, but it's possible you didn't notice the changes I made today. Most specifically, my site's new location: [thedubiousmonk.net](http://thedubiousmonk.net). I just felt like it was time for a change from the Hungry J Propaganda name. I also have a new email address: jju|at|thedubiousmonk|dot|net .  It'd probably be best if you updated your address books with either that or my GMail. 

Also, remember how I mentioned a bunch of irons in fires a while back? At Reyn's birthday thing last night (which I quite enjoyed, though my headache didn't go away till it was dark out this evening) I told the DJS5ers (who were present, sorry Hassie) so now I'll tell you. There's a chance I might be going to Cairo. Not for a little trip but to do another MCC term. 

Since the only thing I've done that is at all in demand in this world is teaching EFL, it seems that's what my job would primarily be (and I'll teach them all to split infinitives just like that - no wait, does would be count as an infinitive whatever?). This would be better teaching than it was in China as they'd be evening classes with adults. So remember all that "Whew! I'm glad I never have to be a teacher again!" stuff I said? Yeah. I'm a big liar. Or hypocrite or something. Maybe I just like complaining.

In any case, I haven't actually been accepted yet. You may remember my escapades this past summer with trying to be employed by Mennonites and the conclusion I came to. This is service though, not employment. It's entirely possible they will still decide not to take me. I did talk about metaphor in my "What Jesus means to me" portion of the application. We'll see. Soon? By Christmas at the latest. I hope.

I'm really excited about going though. The thing I'm best at in this world is being somewhere else. I loved Cairo when Reyn and I were there five years ago. It's not cold there. There's desert. A few people have already said they'll come visit. And James says the MCC Egypt bunch are really good people.

I've been in talks with MCC HR for the last few weeks, and the agonizing "should I?" "is this really what I want?" bugs have been more or less ironed out (another benefit of my job is the amount of concentrated thinking time I've had on this). So yeah. That's the plan.
