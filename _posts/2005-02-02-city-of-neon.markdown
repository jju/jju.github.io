Sweet merciful crap I like it here!
  

  
I'm staying in the infamous Chungking Mansions and will have Indian food there tonight.  There are places that sell sandwiches, beautiful sandwiches.  There are cameras for sale everywhere.  There's a subway/metro!  I love subways!  Especially when they're clean and fast and talk to me in English.
  

  
Maybe it wouldn't be as impressive straight off the boat from Canada, but this is what a city should be like.
  

  
That said, it's not as warm as I wanted.  I mean, I'm wearing a jacket and a sweater, but my fingers aren't numb so yippie kiyay mister falcon.
