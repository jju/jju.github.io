It's been a while since I got any real writing done, so today was sweet.  I cleaned up one story and submitted it to a magazine.  Supposedly this online production has a 30 day turnaround on acceptance, so it can easily be submitted elsewhere if they turn out not to want it.  I also did a clean up on a much longer story that I'm going to submit to a different (print) magazine.  That one actually pays enough that it would actually make a meaningful contribution to my rent for a month.  So that's something.  
  
Also, I learned that the micro-play I mentioned was at the Montreal fringe festival got adapted into a one-man version before being performed on the Saturday night.  I'm unsure exactly if my version or the modded version of the script will show up in the projectbook.  In any case, my name's still on it.  I'll see about posting a version here some time.  
  
Now I just have to finish off the first issue and create a synopsis for my Taoist-Cyberpunk graphic novel so I can start the job of finding an artist and a publisher.  There's a thread on [THE ENGINE](http://the-engine.net/) where I'll probably try find an artist, as opposed to going the local/friend-who-can-draw route.  I really like [this guy's style](http://www.samimakkonen.blogspot.com/) as the kind of thing I'm looking for.
