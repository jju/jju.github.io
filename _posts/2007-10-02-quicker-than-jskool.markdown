Want a book telling you how to be a journalist? Here's [Journalism 2.0: How to Survive and Thrive.](http://www.j-lab.org/Journalism_20.pdf) A “digital literacy guide for the information age” by Mark Briggs, in a 2MB PDF. I got this link from [warrenellis.com](http://warrenellis.com). Just flipping through it now, clicking I guess, and it looks good, like the Benedetti class updated for our times. Probably more useful to people within a news organization than someone like me, but whatever. I like to pretend I'm a journalist sometimes.
