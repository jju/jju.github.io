Yesterday I did my advance voting and there was an Indian gentleman in line in front of me. He was probably in his fifties or sixties and he was pissed off at the election volunteers. See, he gave them ID when they asked and then they had the temerity to ask for something with his address on it (as per Elections Canada rules). He seemed to take it as an affront to his citizenship, saying stuff like "I have lived here for these forty years! You are wrong" Why do you want me not to vote? Fine! I will not vote!" The volunteers were saying that they just needed a bill or something that proved he was voting in the correct place, but he was just angry and convinced everyone was stupid but him. After the supervisor came over to help, he stormed out, leaving his passport behind so he could go get "some stupid piece of paper that I don't even need!" They were really happy when I was easy to manage.

Then I picked up a pile of great books from Abraham, one of my classmates. A whole shwack of stuff about Chinese history and language and religion, plus a bunch of Italo Calvino books. So good. He's pared down his books to two boxes which is really impressive. Some days I feel like I'd like to do that. But my books are important to me. I'm not as conflicted about them [as I was last year](http://thedubiousmonk.net/2010/03/06/still-existing-when-the-covers-are-shut/). We'll see how I feel when I move them away from Vancouver.

And today I packed up all my books and clothes into my storage space. I was very conscious of the order I put stuff in there today, so the most necessary books are more accessible than the infamous theology books. Also, my winter gear is right at the front and accessible for when Holly and I return in December from the height of Antipodean summer and stop off to go to Virginia for Xmas (and for me to make Santa Claus jokes I'm sure no one in that state has ever heard).

I like living in a city undergoing a traumatic sporting event. Everywhere today, people have been talking about this Canucks game tonight.  The buses always have their Go Canucks Go signs in their lights, but today they felt a little more urgent. At the van rental place the guy said they might be closed by the time I returned the van "because, y'know, the game." We're hosting (I say "we" and "hosting" in the same sentence like I'm actually doing stuff beyond showing up - hell, Marlis is cleaning the kitchen right now while I type) a potluck tonight but it came to our attention that we'll need to have the hockey streaming or else everyone would stay home. I doubt it'll be like this in Winnipeg if they really do get an NHL team back, but maybe I'm just a pessimist.
