I just watched [The Ladykillers](http://imdb.com/title/tt0335245/) and I say meh.  I don't want to be one of those people who gets mad at people for making movies I don't like.  It's not like the Coen brothers have some contract signed in blood that says they can only make movies I like.  If that was the movie they wanted to make, fine.  Same with [Intolerable Cruelty](http://imdb.com/title/tt0138524/).  They're not the same as their other movies, which in turn are different from each other.
