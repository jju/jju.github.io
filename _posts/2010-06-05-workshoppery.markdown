Today was part two of this comics making workshop I attended at the library. It was one of those things that made me wish I could draw and don't have to rely on finding a collaborator to turn my comics ideas into something. That's why I've been shifting away from my comics I suppose. Writing without pictures doesn't require me to find a person to help me. I can hack away all by myself without bothering anyone. But these two sessions were pretty good. I think I got more out of last week's than this week's but whatever. It does feel good to have been in a room with people who care about the same sorts of things I do. I didn't take full advantage of it because I didn't want to get in the way of the younger people who the session was really for.</excuse>

Unrelated, I have a place to live in Vancouver! Thank you, Mennonite connections.
