Goddamn it is cold out. I really and truly hate it. Although, since it's cold cold outside and merely not-warm in my apartment I can feel the difference, which makes me happier than Chinese winters did. Shiverring more inside than out is just wrong, and there's no chance of that here at least. That's a bright side, right?

I borrowed Mom's truck today to buy a reading chair for my library/office. It's okay. Kind of cheap, but that's what I was looking to spend and the MCC Furniture Thrift Store was closed. Of course I wrecked it as soon as I took it out of the box to put it together, but figured out a way to overcome my stupidity and now one would probably not even notice. Although my bigger friends should probably not plop themselves down into it without consideration.

Friday was our staff Christmas/Going Away for Theresa party. I had a very good time. Ate good food and talked about some library stuff and some not. I got to tell my "unacceptable Storytime theme" story to people who'd never heard it and who were properly flabbergasted. Met some of the people who I keep on hearing about but had never worked with. All in all a good time.

One of the former Sir William-ers quit the library and isn't working anywhere right now. She said she'd looked at her life and asked if being a government employee was what she'd wanted out of her life when she was young and had dreams. It wasn't, so she quit. And I filed that away in the "don't work at the library forever" part of my brain. This is where working on the book is important. I still have the illusion that I am doing something interesting with my life. Although I haven't heard what my first reader has to say about the first section yet.
