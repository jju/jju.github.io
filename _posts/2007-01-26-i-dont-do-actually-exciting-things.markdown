I did some more painting today and read a bit and most importantly did the rough outlining of a scifi story.  I hate talking about things here before they're past the "couple of pagefuls of notes" stage, but I do it anyway.  Selah.  Maybe I'll call Hassie tomorrow.  He could have some good technical insight.  Anyway, it's the kind of story that might actually sell (and will work much better as a story than as a comic) so I should get cracking on it instead of the projects that won't help me out on the grocery front.  Who am I kidding?  I get paid for writing something, that money goes straight into books or toys.  I'm such a twelve year old.  
  
Friday is the day the 50th [le pingouink (Now in English)](http://www.webcomicsnation.com/hjp/pingouink) strip goes up.  That's kind of cool.
