The best part about coming back to Wanzhou is that I don't have to try and remember where I ate the night before and avoid it.
  

  
Yeah, really.  That's the best thing.
  

  
Or sort of a harsh version of the best thing.  I always love going to Nanchong where I have friends to hang out with and make jokes with and feel vaguely normal.  And it is always sort of sad that I can only do that every few weeks.
  

  
But it's also good because then actually being there is special and I don't take it for granted.  And I can save up stories and things and unleash them periodically on an unsuspecting audience before they show too much boredom.
