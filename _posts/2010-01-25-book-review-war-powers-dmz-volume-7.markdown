[War Powers](http://www.librarything.com/work/8492473/book/55453219) evidently falls somewhere in the second act of Brian Wood's comic DMZ. The art remains dirty and everything you'd want out of a new american civil war in New York, but I have to admit I feel like Matty Roth (the journalist protagonist) feels like he's losing his way. This volume he spends doing political work, not being the voice in the wilderness. I don't know. I'm not saying Mr. Wood is writing it wrong or anything, but I miss the way Matty used to be. In this volume he takes a stand that I don't agree with, not one bit. It's still a good story, but I feel like it's becoming a sad one.
