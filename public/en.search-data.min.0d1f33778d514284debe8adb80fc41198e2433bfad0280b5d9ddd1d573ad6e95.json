There are a bunch of reasons for that, which I\u0026rsquo;ll be detailing below, along with some history and further reading1 by people who know more than me.\nCyclocross as a Sport\r#\rSo you know about riding a bike right? Bikes have two wheels and pedals and handlebars to steer. The important thing you learn as a kid is how to balance and then off you go. You ride around on the sidewalk, on the road, in fields, through the woods and maybe build a ramp and do some sick jumps. You\u0026rsquo;re just riding a bike.\nWell, as is so often the case in this world market segmentation came for cycling2. Nowadays there are a pile of different disciplines of cycling (and attendant different bikes3). Your big divisions are between Road Cycling and Mountain Biking. Road biking is skinnier tires (22-30c) on paved roads. This is the Tour de France kind of thing. Mountain Biking happens off road and uses burlier bikes with bigger tires (like 2-4 inches wide). Each of these has a host of different subdivisions (Time Trials, Track, Cross-Country, Downhill, Enduro, Touring) people can specialize in4 because each rewards different skills.\nCyclocross is a specific kind of bike racing (so it\u0026rsquo;s not a transportation-focused kind of riding) that happens off-road but with road-ish bikes. In its contemporary form you ride your bike around in a field and sometimes have to get off your bike and carry it because the hills are too steep or there are stairs or someone put a bunch of boards across the track. I often think of it as the least efficient way of using your bike. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nOne of the things that makes it awesome is its compactness. A good cyclocross course is a couple of kilometres long and loops around in twists and turns in a small space. This means it\u0026rsquo;s easy to watch. Riders are doing multiple laps and everyone is going at different speeds so as a spectator you can be in one spot and stuff will happen in front of you for you to cheer for. Sure, your favourite rider might take 10 minutes to come back around but there\u0026rsquo;ll be others in the meantime.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s as a spectator, but as a rider what I love is how fucking hard it can be. You\u0026rsquo;re riding a bike really inefficiently purely for the absurd joy of doing it. There\u0026rsquo;s no pretense of transportation, just effort and technique. But it\u0026rsquo;s also a manageable length of time. Elite races are only an hour long. When I race (in the slowpoke category) we\u0026rsquo;re only talking 45 minutes. That feels endless when your legs are burning and lungs are popping, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t. You\u0026rsquo;re constantly managing that amount of fatigue, and knowing it\u0026rsquo;s only a set amount of time you can go harder and really push your limits. Also, knowing that if something happens to you or your bike you\u0026rsquo;re walking distance from your car is pretty helpful too.\nCyclocross Course Features\r#\rAccording to the UCI5\u0026rsquo;s rule 5.1.012:\nA cyclo-cross course shall include road, country and forest paths and meadowland alternating in such a way as to ensure changes in the pace of the race and allowing riders to recuperate after difficult sections.\nThen in rule 5.1.017 we get:\nThe course must form a closed circuit of a minimum length of 2.5 km and maximum 3.5 km, of which at least 90% shall be ridable.\nAnd the very next rule (5.1.018) says:\nThe course must be at least 3 meters wide throughout and clearly marked and protected on both sides.\nThe markings referred to there are usually long ribbons of tape attached to poles on spikes around here, but in fancy-pants races they can be much more elaborate. On courses where you go through the woods there\u0026rsquo;s generally a trail with trees or bushes to the sides so you might not be putting up barriers.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s what a \u0026lsquo;cross course looks like. It sounds so simple, but that leaves out all the cool bits.\nSteep Stuff\r#\rIf a CX course is supposed to be 90% rideable, what makes something unrideable? Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just a really steep bit. Climbing up a short \u0026ldquo;wall\u0026rdquo; of dirt might be doable if you had a lot of momentum coming in, but these courses are twisty so often you\u0026rsquo;re coming in relatively slowly, making hopping off the bike, shouldering it and scrambling up the hill the most practical approach.\nOf course, if you can ride up that, this kind of feature can be a \u0026ldquo;difference maker\u0026rdquo; for a rider with good enough skills.\nNevertheless, Nys proved on lap five of seven that his technique was unmatched on this course. In particular, his ability to ride up the off camber and incredibly steep “100% hill” when no other rider could gave him two to three seconds every lap.6\nSome courses will have stairs that you have to run up as well7.\nIn my experience (as a terrible old fearful cx rider) the really steep downhills can also be a problem especially with a tight corner at the bottom, and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll see that in elite races, but usually because it\u0026rsquo;s slippery or there\u0026rsquo;s a surface change8 or something.\nThat slipperiness makes a real difference in races though. Even if something isn\u0026rsquo;t too steep to ride if it\u0026rsquo;s dry, if it\u0026rsquo;s wet or muddy and you\u0026rsquo;d be fighting your tires the whole way up, you often see even good riders just running up a hill instead of messing about.\nBarriers\r#\rBarriers in cyclocross are low walls across the course that people have to get off their bike to jump over, or if they\u0026rsquo;re good enough bike handlers they can hop their bikes over them. Not everyone even in the pro ranks hops the planks, but it sure looks cool when they do.\nAt one of the ABA races in 2023, someone tried to hop the barrier and hit it which bent the heck out of it. The next day\u0026rsquo;s race one of the organizers told everyone in the novice class that there are only a couple of people who could clear the barriers with a bunnyhop at the race and none of them were in our class. So don\u0026rsquo;t do it!\nJust Using Tape\r#\rWhen courses have a big open flattish area sometimes course designers weave the tape around to make corkscrewy paths to ride around. Making \u0026lsquo;cross riders do sharp turns slows people down and means you\u0026rsquo;re doing a bunch of sharp accelerations.\nFurther Reading\r#\rHow to build a good cyclocross course Cyclocross and Me\r#\rCyclocross Season Summary 2022 Cyclocross Season Summary 2023 Cyclocross Season Summary 2024 Cyclocross Season Summary 2025 Further reading on this site (which will be more personal responses and the like) can be found under the cx tag.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis happened decades ago; you weren\u0026rsquo;t around for some actual purer time of cycling (apart from just being a kid and riding your bike without giving a shit about any of this).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nand accessories and clothes and podcasts etc.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nand buy shit for\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUnion Cycliste Internationale - the organizing body and no fun police of official cycling.

I tend to use those tools well so I serve by putting those skills to work for the public.\nBut.\nMore and more I hate am disenchanted with this world. I understand that the world is objectively better because of the ways that information and communication technology have modified it. Even the cesspool of social media hate is useful because it makes obvious how terrible people are, even when they aren\u0026rsquo;t being terrible to you. Sharing information is good, though not unreservedly so. And in the last few years as I\u0026rsquo;ve grown less and less enamoured with the internet I\u0026rsquo;ve been falling in love with bikes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a clean replacement, of course. I use the internet to think about bikes and get ideas for future bikes and shop for bike parts. The manufacture of these bikes is part of the whole overseas manufacturing supply chain that relies on standardized shipping containers and that same communication and fossil fuel burning network that I am trying to escape.\nBut I can escape with a bike. I can ride and it feels like flying even if I\u0026rsquo;m actually not very fast.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/250821-before-cross-comes/","title":"before cross comes","section":"Posts","content":"The summer is almost done and I haven\u0026rsquo;t updated this site in ages. But that is okay. I\u0026rsquo;m fine with not having written. Really and truly.\nThis year I haven\u0026rsquo;t biked as much as I did last year. Part of that is because I\u0026rsquo;ve started volunteering once a week at Bike Edmonton, which takes up time. Part of it is just being tired, and demoralized for being slow. I took up the mantle of Mountain Bike representative for VCC which meant I missed a few ftt races riding alone in capilanopark instead. When I did get in a couple of races, I was oh so slow, even though I worked so hard. I didn\u0026rsquo;t make it out to the good mountain biking at all this summer. I didn\u0026rsquo;t ride to work as much as I wanted. Just generally a blah kind of year.\nBut a couple of days ago, I grabbed the CX bike and rode around, up and down grassy hills, pushing hard for short bits of time. I burped a tire and decided I\u0026rsquo;ll actually run tubes this year (with the benefit of being actually UCI-legal for tire width). Upon checking in with myself, I was pretty happy. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes between the tape.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/250131-64squares/","title":"thinking about 64 squares","section":"Posts","content":"I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to focus a bit this past year. When I come home to a quiet house (four days a week) there are many things I could do. Watch shows, read books, cook interesting meals, go out and spend money being around people. But when I have all those options the tendency I have is to just kind of waste it. To work on that I\u0026rsquo;ve got three main things I\u0026rsquo;m working on filling my time with: bikes, books, and chess.\nChess is the one that is the weirdest for me. I have played games for a long time. As a teenager I worked at my hometown\u0026rsquo;s best game store and have many memories of 40K1 and RPGs2 and even some CCGs3. These days games are one of my easiest ways to fall into consumerist behaviour. I get caught up in the idea of a game and then buy it even if I have no one to play it with4. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t play chess a huge amount as a kid, even after I learned how to play. It seemed like something I should play5, but just didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nA couple of years ago, though, I started hosting our library\u0026rsquo;s chess meetup. It was something people had been inquiring about as we reopened after pandemic lockdowns, and it seemed like it could be easy enough to get going. It was! It started slow but now we get about a dozen people showing up every week.\nEven though this means I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing chess weekly, I have resisted getting competitive. Most of my role in this is as host and facilitator, not \u0026ldquo;chess expert.\u0026rdquo; And chess itself is pretty nakedly competitive, so preserving my library role (which is very not-competitive) means even when I\u0026rsquo;m playing games of chess I\u0026rsquo;m not playing to win. But I do want to get better, to understand things better. Because sometimes I play against one of the good players and they say things like \u0026ldquo;this is a very interesting position\u0026rdquo; and I don\u0026rsquo;t see it. I\u0026rsquo;d like to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a way of thinking about chess that sees it as limiting. Caring about 64 squares and how the pieces on them are arranged is not the most important thing in the world. Not even close. But there\u0026rsquo;s so much room to get absorbed in there, to see the difference between a boring position and an interesting one, and that room of nigh-infinite possibilities is like fractally enticing. How much of anything I do is actually important6? Why not get lost in this little square of art and competition?\nI get these feelings sometimes when I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about being useful compared to being happy, which comes up a lot with caring about games, or sports, or comics, or any of the other things I get wrapped up in. Instead of Pokemon, chess feels like poetry, like something almost respectable to get lost in.\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;m reading more. I\u0026rsquo;m studying. I\u0026rsquo;m recording my games and analyzing them. It\u0026rsquo;s a good world for me to get into because it\u0026rsquo;s not demanding of buying more and more stuff. Chess feels outside of that whole thing. I know it\u0026rsquo;s not. But it feels like it could be.\nWarhammer 40,000: a science fiction miniatures wargame that began as a parody of Thatcherite Britain\u0026rsquo;s creeping fascism but now is a corporate behemoth in the gaming world. There\u0026rsquo;s also a smaller scale gangwarfare game called Necromunda, which was our group\u0026rsquo;s favourite 20 years ago.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRole Playing Games: telling stories with randomizers and friends.

Some years we\u0026rsquo;ve (apparently) had snow right for the first races. There are kind of three aspects to the season for me. A bunch of training, the casual races and the sanctioned Alberta Cup races.\nTraining is training. I ride up and down hills and in parks.\nWednesday Night Worlds\r#\rMuch like the Fat Tire Tuesday races, Edmonton has a series of $5 cx races in \u0026lsquo;cross season. The A group starts a minute before the B group which starts a minute before the C group and everyone races for about 25 minutes.\nRace 1 2024-09-04: stravalink There were so many people at Capilano Park it was great. As I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered is usual there, I hated the \u0026ldquo;down a steep hill then u-turn to climb it again\u0026rdquo; manoeuvre. On one of my laps (I did 5) I got tangled in the tape (my downhill cornering could use some work) and had to run up the hill, but I made it through the rest of the times cleanly. I felt like I was in decent shape but man, I work a lot harder than when I do practice laps out there. Race 2 2024-09-11: I had to work. Boooooo. Apparently they finished up just as the rain started. Race 3 2024-09-18: stravalink Back at Capilano Park and a slightly different course. I think this one was easier. They had a down a hill then up u-turn, but the really sharp one was in a smaller downhill zone so you didn\u0026rsquo;t have as much speed to shed. And the one with the bigger downhill had a couple of bends to it and a much wider corner at the bottom (going around a tree) which was much easier to handle.1 Race 4 2024-09-25 stravalink I was slow slow slow down at Argyll Park but I managed most of the course smoothly enough. I was working on my leaning through my descending turns, which will hopefully help my confidence at the weekend\u0026rsquo;s race. Race 5 2024-10-02 stravalink Back at Capilano where I decided to try something different by going hard at the beginning and trying to stay with the faster folk in my B group. I managed to do it for a couple of laps but then faded and got passed. I ended up in front of my benchmark person in the group and only got lapped by the A group once. Race 6 2024-10-09 stravalink Apparently there\u0026rsquo;d been a thing on instagram or something letting people know they should ride a cool bike or dress up for the race, but I missed it. Technically that meant I should have started down in the bowl at Argyll and then ran up to grab a bike2, but I\u0026rsquo;m slow so I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that. What did happen was being in the middle of a pack going up the steep hills. Someone stopped in front of my Velocity clubmate David, and he fell and then I ran into his bike. We were all okay, but yeesh. After that I had a good ride. I managed my steep downhills and put in good power on my climbs. I\u0026rsquo;m sad it was the last WNW of the season, but I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to being able to bike to work on Wednesdays again (since I don\u0026rsquo;t have somewhere to be when my chess program is done).

Races at Capilano are grass grass grass (with a few roots on the 50m of singletrack), but at Voyageur Park you\u0026rsquo;ve got grass and dirt and pavement and a beach and sand, all in the leaves changing colour, so it\u0026rsquo;s nice. Different terrain also forces the racers into different choices. I was watching the Sport Men mostly from the sand pit while kibitzing with a few more experienced racers. There was a choice to make there over whether to try riding the sand or to pick up your bike and run. When I was watching most people were running it. I tried to ride it on my preride, but with the hairpin coming in, it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it. If you could stay on, you\u0026rsquo;d have a better chance of also riding up the short uphill right after the pit, but more people I saw put their bikes down then rode up after smoother remounts than I\u0026rsquo;m capable of.\n2\nAnother choice was the downhill pictured above. There was \u0026ndash; to my view \u0026ndash; a choice between two lines from the top (which you reached via a steep runup): a) straight down the steep dirt with a sharp right-hander on the paved bike path at the bottom, or b) turning right on the dirt about a quarter way down to ride a narrower chute that came straight out onto the bike path. In pre-ride I took the straight down path because of a root in the middle of the descent and I felt it was more manageable. But once I was actually chasing people, I went for the right hand path even though we were starting to tear up the ground making it more treacherous to get into it. In the end I managed it all right (and also cut off one of my competitors going into it, which got me a gap), which was so much better than last year\u0026rsquo;s panic attack at the top of that hill3.\nLater in the course there was another choice between a steeper and a slightly more roundabout climb. I took the less steep way, mostly to get a bit of recovery. But all in all the number of choices available are what make this course my favourite. Next year I\u0026rsquo;ll try and arrange my time so I do both races of the weekend instead of just one.\nresults\r#\rABA Results CrossResults Podia\r#\rOpen Women\r#\rChristiane BILODEAU4 Annie SCOTT Shantel KOENIG Open Men\r#\rFinn BORSTMAYER Ryan MACLEAN5 Sean GERMAINE Expert Men\r#\rAaron STAGG Ryan ARYCHUK Quinten MACKLEM Sport Women\r#\rAnna EGGERS6 Emily YOUNG Hayley DEGAUST Sport Men\r#\rColin WEIR CHABA Michael STOLARZ Eton KOHLENBERG Novice Men\r#\rLucas DONAGHY7 Aiden SANDMAIER Timothy UTTING my results\r#\r9th place (out of 16) - Novice Men 45:44 read more\r#\rPuncheur Cross 2024 My 2023 Experience at Hop N Hurl Running the sand. - Photo by me.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nChoosing a line. - Photo by me.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAfterwards, my clubmate and Expert Men \u0026lsquo;crosser Jason told me I should have taken the grass over for the entirely straight shot through to the right.

The course went backwards compared to Jim Horner the previous day. This was good for me because it meant we had a non-technical climb right after the start, and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m pretty decent at. It also meant that the switchbacks we\u0026rsquo;d been climbing on Saturday were now a descent. I\u0026rsquo;m never super great at these kinds of things and in the pre-ride lots of people were testing and re-testing the lines1. After one wipeout when I was trying to cut it too close, I settled on unclipping my inside foot and dabbing a touch as I went around the steepest part. The best part of this feature was that it would be at the end of the lap so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a huge mass of riders hitting it at the same time.\nMy race went well. I got up with the front group on the initial climb, lost a few places on the flatter sections and then maintained my spot. A couple of the guys I chased on Saturday were now chasing me for most of the race, which I did not enjoy. In the end the one I was most worried about (who I\u0026rsquo;d just barely beaten at WNW a few days previously) got gapped and I could do my last lap pretty calmly. There was also a U15 kid on my tail in the first 3(?) laps but I lost him when he faded.\nThe other great thing ERTC did was organize $5 handups. There\u0026rsquo;s a spot on the course where you have to climb a steep hill and turn at the top. The proper way to do it is to cut to the inside to make the corner less sharp and the climb less steep. But in the spirit of \u0026lsquo;cross they had a person in a bee costume posted at the outside of the corner with $5 bills for racers who took that much worse line to grab. I skipped it my first couple of laps but once I had a bit of a gap on my chasers in lap 3 I decided to go for it. I did manage to grab it without stopping or wiping out or getting passed, which I was proud of myself for. It took a while to get access to my pocket to tuck the money away but I did.\nIn the end I didn\u0026rsquo;t crack the top 5 (which is my dreamy goal for a race this season), but stayed nice and mid-pack with my 10th.\nresults\r#\rABA Results CrossResults Podia\r#\rOpen Women\r#\rShantel KOENIG2 Emma SCOTT Jay SMITH Open Men\r#\rSean GERMAINE3 Ryan MACLEAN4 Jack PURDY Expert Men\r#\rBrendan CARDIFF5 Quinten MACKLEM6 Randy PERRY7 Sport Women\r#\rDaniella BREWSTER Anna EGGERS8 Emily YOUNG9 Sport Men\r#\rRyan ARYCHUK10 Eton KOHLENBERG Craig VERMETTE Novice Men\r#\rJett FENTON11 Aiden SANDMAIER12 Timothy UTTING my results\r#\r10th place (out of 21) - Novice Men read more\r#\rJim Horner Grand Prix 2024 School of Cross 2023 One of the women I was talking with decided just to run it and not risk the wipeout at all.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSecond place the day before.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThird place the day before.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThird place in 2023.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVCC woo!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFirst place Novice Men in 2023.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThird place the day before and in 2023.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFirst place the day before.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSecond place the day before.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFirst place the day before, second place in 2023.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEarned promotion up to Sport Men, with his second win (in a row, following JHGP) in Novice.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSecond place the day before.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/races/jimhornergrandprix2024/","title":"jim horner grand prix 2024","section":"Races","content":"\rTech Guide Location: Capilano Park Edmonton Course: stravalink 1\nThe Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well.

The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it). I did that switchback okay in practice, but on the opening lap I totally wiped out, delaying a bunch of people behind me. Once that was out of the way though, I had a good race. I was following some people and eventually passed them. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite get in touch with the leaders of the race but I had a pretty good run.\n2\nI then spent the rest of the day hanging out at the bike races, which was fun.

The idea with a gravel race is it\u0026rsquo;s a long route on dirt roads away from traffic. There\u0026rsquo;s a mass start and though there are fast people \u0026ldquo;racing\u0026rdquo; the event there will be far more just out there doing the ride, trying to finish and have a good time1.\nThere are a few organized events in Alberta, spanning the calendar from June to October2. I settled on The Range mostly because they have an arrangement with a couple of ranches in southern Alberta where you get access to their roads which would normally be closed. Being able to ride somewhere I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just go and ride by myself was a big draw.\nI drove down to Claresholm on Friday night to pick up my race number and check into a motel. No camping because I wanted a better sleep than I could get in a hot tent3. The town of Claresholm was small and right next to canola fields and foothills a bit further away. I spent my evening preparing my bike and reminding myself not to go too hard too early in the race. I definitely felt some impostery feelings. I was doing this not on a fancy gravel bike, just my old cyclocrosser Bullwinkle. My tires were probably too knobby. I was probably too weak to finish before the time cut. This was all a huge mistake.\nMorning came and I felt better. I ate my overnight oats and headed for the start line.\n4\nThe first part of the race I was very conscious of not overextending myself. I rode in bunches and didn\u0026rsquo;t doo too much to try and catch people when they picked up the pace. Eventually though I started catching up with people on some climbs. After passing Albert (you can see him on the eye-catching pink bike (which I always try to compliment him on) in the picture above) I caught up with a couple of Terrascape racers who were going a nice easy pace. I hung with them for a long time until we were caught by some of the people I\u0026rsquo;d left behind climbing earlier. When they passed I felt nice and recovered so I rolled with them.\nOnce hitting the ranch, I\u0026rsquo;d gotten away from the group. I did the creek crossing and made it to the first aid station where I availed myself of a cold wet neck sponge thing someone\u0026rsquo;s grandma had made for the riders. Then it was up The Wall.\nI\u0026rsquo;d been warned about the Wall, but due to some inattention I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize I\u0026rsquo;d be climbing it in both directions. In my head when I reached the top of this climb, the worst of the whole event was over. Ha! I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it would have made that much of a difference in my approach to know differently \u0026ndash; maybe I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have emptied myself out so much on this climb \u0026ndash; but still.\nAfter that climb it was a super-steep descent where I was pulling the brakes mightily. I made it to the bottom without incident and then realized how much climbing there was left to do. It was so much - not as steep as the wall, but long. I had to walk for a while because even in my spinniest gear I couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep pedaling. Eventually I reached the peak and started down.\n5\nI\u0026rsquo;m not a confident descender so I was passed by a bunch of folks coming down. At one point I did have to stop and take a couple of pictures because holy crap it was a beautiful day and it felt great to be riding a bike out there. Then more descending (with some climbs where I was occasionally passing people who\u0026rsquo;d passed me going down). This was more gradual than the white-knuckle steepness coming down from the Wall, but I gradually realized I\u0026rsquo;d have to ride up that steepness, so anxiety was building. Thankfully when I rounded the corner to see the Wall again, everyone in sight was walking their bikes up, so I did too.\nThat was it! Now I could freewheel down the hill carefully to the aid station. I was free and clear! Huzzah! Then I hit some loose gravel that was covering the good line and my front wheel went left out from under me and I hit the ground skidding. I didn\u0026rsquo;t hit my head. As I picked myself and bike up to get out of the way of the riders descending, I assessed things. My chest was dirty. My hips felt scraped. I had some bloodiness on my knee and elbow. When I got my bike up my levers were twisted from the impact. I tested the brakes and they still worked even from their weird positions, so I could still ride it, which I did down to the aid station.\nAt the station they were amazing. There was a mechanic from Ridley\u0026rsquo;s who got my levers back in appropriate-ish positions. There was a paramedic who cleaned out my knee and elbow wounds and wrapped up my elbow (and said \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s all soft tissue, but you might want an x-ray\u0026rdquo;). And there were hydrators giving me water, and new cold neckie things and making me feel really lucky I crashed where I did. The mechanic did the best he could but my handlebars were actually bent so I\u0026rsquo;d have \u0026ldquo;bad ergo\u0026rdquo; for the rest of the ride, though I should be okay to do the last 40km. It could have been so much worse.\nFor the last third of the race I eventually caught on with a few guys I\u0026rsquo;d passed and been passed by and rode with them to the end. I was hurting so I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any pulls on the front, which I felt bad about near the end when one of them totally cracked and the others stuck with him out of solidarity. I rolled on alone for the last 3 km or so and finished my first gravel event in 86th place overall.\nAfterwards I was chatting with a couple of VCC riders (who are older and faster than me) about how different that was than a group ride on the road. Just the extra energy you have to spend on the rougher surfaces and the shattering effects where you aren\u0026rsquo;t just doing pulls for 1/8 the time or whatever. I think it was the amount of work that made me like it, made me feel like this was a worthy accomplishment to focus my summer on6.\nNext year if I go back, I know how much of a climb I need to be ready for and I can train for that better. I can also probably not crash, which would have been nice.\nresults\r#\r76/132 Men (86/149 Overall) in the 122 km distance 5:49:46 (-1:51:01 behind winner) Zone 4 Results Basically a mullet: \u0026ldquo;Business in the front; party in the back.\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn 2024 Ghost of the Gravel in June was the Canadian National Gravel Championship, Velocity Afterburner in September is the Alberta Provincial Gravel Championship, then there\u0026rsquo;s The Range in July, Festivus of Gravel in August, and the Croken Classic in October.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEarlier in the week the forecast had been for 36 Celsius and the organizers had shortened the route.

I\u0026rsquo;d been waiting on my race fee reimbursement before entering the Stieda Classic again, but that came kind of late. A couple of people from my club mentioned that since I\u0026rsquo;m a bit better climber than a big powerful guy, I might find Pigeon Lake more suitable. I debated a bunch, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I tried it out.\nFirst off, there were more people in the race than could fit on a podium so it felt real! The citizen class shared a start time with the Fondo group so there were people to compare my ride with right off the hop.\n1\nThree of the other racers and I joined up at the front. I heard one of them say to another \u0026ldquo;One minute pulls?\u0026rdquo; and figured I would just slot into that. After 10 km or so we had our first hill and dropped one of the guys. The three remaining pushed for a while before figuring we were probably well away from the bunch so we could ease off a bit.\nOn our second lap of the course it became evident that one of the three guys was not doing so well on the hills, but instead of dropping him, David and I kept the group together. He thanked us, but I know I wanted his big body out in the way when we got to the headwind section, so it felt a little self-serving.\nIn the end I did a bit too much work on the last few kilometres, letting David get an easy ride. The other guy sat up for the sprint and David came around me. He said afterwards he felt super-empty, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to do to take advantage of it. In the end, he won but it was a great ride.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible that next year I\u0026rsquo;m going to branch out from the Citizen category to get my ass kicked in Cat 4 racing, but for now this stands as a highlight for my bike riding.

I got caught behind a couple of riders who went way slower than I could have, putting me in a hole the rest of the race. I was chasing a Hardcore Bike Club rider for most of the rest of the race. I gained time on the ups; he gained time everywhere else. There was one descent that was steep, kind of muddy and had a turn into a bridge right at the bottom. I had a tough time with it on my practice lap and managed to wipe out on it in Lap 2 (I\u0026rsquo;m a B-Group rider so I only did 3 laps). 5/6 for 6 points Race 2 2024-05-281 : stravalink There was a prologue to stretch the group out a little before hitting the singletrack this week. Loads of climbing on this course. I was following one rider for most of the first lap before a pedal strike knocked me to a halt and my lost momentum meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t see her again until the last third of the third lap. The rooty climb was tough, and I messed up the line on lap 2. In the end I was lapped by a lot of the fast group riders (by two of them in lap 2). 9/10 for 2 points Race 3 2024-06-182 : stravalink The organizers made this a shorter loop because the Oilers were playing a must-win game in the Stanley Cup Final, so they wanted us to get out of there quickly. I was chasing another B-group rider on the second lap who, when she passed me said \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry; I\u0026rsquo;m slow on the downhills.\u0026rdquo; So as she was opening more of a gap going down I tried to go faster and then a moment of inattention meant I clipped my bars on a tree and crashed. It hurt. I finished the race, but never did catch up with her. 4/6 for 7 points Race 4 2024-06-25: stravalink This was pretty much the same course as the first FTT race of the year (although for some reason, the segment says it\u0026rsquo;s longer). I wiped out on that same off-camber descent I had trouble with in May, but managed to hang onto 2nd place in the B-Group nonetheless.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been out for a couple of VCC rides this season where it\u0026rsquo;s been about 11 degrees and I wore my tights and seemed to fit in pretty well.\nIn the first week there was a fast group and a slow group, which I definitely knew I should stick with (Strava number notwithstanding). My suspicions were justified the next week when chatting with one of the riders who\u0026rsquo;d been in the first week fast group. Apparently their average speed wasn\u0026rsquo;t that crazy, but they\u0026rsquo;re so strong in the wind. Some of them used to be Cat 11 racers so yeah, best shape of my life is still going to leave me in a puddle by the side of the road keeping up with them.\nIn our second group ride of the season, I went with the slow group, but when we accidentally dropped a couple of riders that group split in two (after turning around to catch them back up). I went with the faster of the two and that was good. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the strongest but I could do decent pulls2 and ended up going pretty quickly.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s fun riding fast on the road, I\u0026rsquo;m also doing some trail riding. My bike-handling skills need work negotiating roots and the ups and downs in the river valley trails, but having the ability to practice is great. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try at least one Fat Tire Tuesday race this spring just to see what getting my butt handed to me on these trails (instead of the CX ones) is like. Generally though, I like mountain biking for being surrounded by trees and the focus rather than the going fast part. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it feels when/if I try to get competitive.\nCat is short for categories in road bike racing. You start off as a Cat 5 and can earn points to move up.

So not being on the front lets you go faster while expending less energy; the riders with their nose in the wind are \u0026ldquo;pulling\u0026rdquo; the rest of the group along. Ideally everyone takes turns doing pulls on the front so everyone gets to share in the free ride effect, but some people are just stronger than others.

Decades. When I was a teen The Next Generation was (along with the Simpsons and the X-Files) the fiction I loved most. I loved the stories; I loved the vision of the future; most of all I loved the characters and could think of nothing better than flying around having adventures solving problems with a found family1. That\u0026rsquo;s still something I love the idea of, and pretty much is my mental model of what I wanted out of a working life.\nI fell out of Star Trek fandom after my undergrad years. Nemesis was such a terrible movie. I dropped Voyager before Seven of Nine joined the show and never watched Enterprise. I saw the first JJ Abrams movie and it was fine but my spark was gone. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the sequels. I watched the first and third seasons of Picard for nostalgic purposes, but could only find bits and pieces of what used to make me happy on TV2.\nNow though, I\u0026rsquo;m in a different place in my life. I\u0026rsquo;m seeking out that idea of the found family zipping around in space. Mostly because my primary relationship broke down, and I\u0026rsquo;m making a new life. It\u0026rsquo;s more complicated doing that when you\u0026rsquo;re sharing parenting across a couple of houses than when you\u0026rsquo;ve got a five-year mission to explore space. So my escapism is bringing me back to Trek. I\u0026rsquo;m going with Discovery for now, hoping these missions and adventures are going to help bring me back to an exploring curious frame of mind.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of sad I need the crutch of big commercial TV to make that happen, but here we are.\nPretty sure this is why on first airing I didn\u0026rsquo;t like Deep Space 9.

It was \u0026lsquo;kerstperiode\u0026rsquo;1 so there were a pile of races to get thoroughly immersed in. I\u0026rsquo;d watch most of a race and then get the final lap queued up for when C could come out of his room and we would watch 15 minutes of muddy bike racing.\nPart of what made this fun was that the 2022-23 elite season had three big stars battling it out in these races. The \u0026ldquo;big three\u0026rdquo; were Tom Pidcock (defending 2022 World Champion from the UK), Wout Van Aert (Belgian superstar) and Mathieu Van Der Poel (Dutch superduperstar). These three were evenly-ish matched and they would have these amazing battles at the front of the races. It was great.\nThe World Championships came down to a final sprint between Van Aert and Van Der Poel that the Dutchman won, making C very happy3. Then the season was mostly over until fall. In August I started rewatching the 2022-23 races on GCN4 while I prepared for my season, which primed me for watching the next season live(ish). I really appreciated the USCX cup and getting to know the American and Canadian riders, especially the women\u0026rsquo;s field (which included Albertan World Cup racer Sidney McGill).\nI was into watching the 2023-24 season on GCN+, but then they shut down before kerstperiode, so I\u0026rsquo;m back to finding YouTube links afterwards. It\u0026rsquo;s not so bad, but I miss the reliability. It softened the blow that this season wasn\u0026rsquo;t as exciting as last year. Van der Poel won almost every race he entered, including defending his World Champion jersey. Fem Van Empel was also great on the women\u0026rsquo;s side but that made the races a bit less compelling. Puck Pieterse\u0026rsquo;s lap videos are available on her YouTube channel, so there\u0026rsquo;s some excellent content for free.\nI\u0026rsquo;m putting off the decision to get a new subscription5 until the summer.

I spent the winter actually using the gym we have at work, doing time on the stationary bike so as not to lose all my kilometres in my legs. They say you should do strength training and I tried but it\u0026rsquo;s a pain.\nThe other thing I did was join a club. Velocity Cycling Club is my new bunch. We have a coach and club jerseys and it\u0026rsquo;s all a bit more community-building than the lone-wolf cyclist thing I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing. I went on a couple of group rides and they were fun. The first was about 60km and easy riding. I self-selected to the slow group, and was the only person in it (along with the bunch leader). But it was good. I got to learn about some of the group riding norms and hand signals. Old Paul was very welcoming in general and did a good job showing me how to get close to people in the bunch.\nBeing part of a club I signed up for another road race. The thought was that maybe it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so lonely out there. I could look for the red jerseys of my people and get some tips. I was in the Citizen category which is the bunch of people who can\u0026rsquo;t get upgrade points but I think that\u0026rsquo;ll be more my speed than trying to race against competitive people.\nIn 2022 I figured out that my bikes are pretty good1 and are not the things holding back my riding; it\u0026rsquo;s my body. Just going for longish rides when I felt like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really giving me more endurance or speed. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty well aware that I\u0026rsquo;m just not fit enough to actually race bikes and be competitive. But still, I tried my first criterium and was slow. Consistent but slow. Being part of the team gave me a reason to volunteer for helping with the crit too, which was fun.\nThen we came into \u0026lsquo;cross season. I raced four races2 which was less than I was hoping. Wildfires cancelled a couple and I had work and an injury and other issues I needed to deal with. It never really came together the way I would have liked. I did try out the midweek cx racing which was fun, and where I met Sidney McGill, World Cup \u0026lsquo;Crosser.\nAccording to crossresults in 2022 I had a rating of 563.863 and in 2023 my rating was 557.78. So by the numbers I was marginally more successful this year. My best race was better than my best in 2022 (Tubs on Tubs 2023 vs Puncheur Cross 2022) and my worst race in 2023 was also better than my worst in 20224.\nMy racing aside, the work I did with the ABA CX Cup stats and getting them uploaded into CrossResults was quite rewarding. Our good riders got better call-ups5 at the Pan-American Championships because their ABA results were somewhere the race organizers could use.\nI think 2024 won\u0026rsquo;t see me expanding my racing too much. I will probably still do a few through the summer, maybe a gravel event, and then try for more \u0026lsquo;cross in the fall, especially the midweek stuff.\nMy hardtail Graymare isn\u0026rsquo;t great, but upgrading it would be really expensive for the amount and style of actual mountain biking I do.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe races were Tubs on Tubs, Jim Horner, Hardcore Hop N Hurl and the second day of Baby Walter Cross.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn their system lower is better.

Unfortunately I had a training crash the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.\nThe day was chillier than 2022, and it prompted a few last minute re-pinnings of numbers on my part as I waffled over wearing the longsleeve jersey. I only really got a chance to do one full recon lap, which was where my first problem happened. There were a pair of steep downhills in the woods. One of them I was okay with, but the second had a sharp right-hand turn at the bottom and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to make it, not with my OTB memory of earlier in the week. I did exactly what you\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to do and looked where I was scared of going. I hit the tape but didn\u0026rsquo;t crash. Then I tried the sand pit and wiped out and twisted my back, pulling something on my left side.\n1\nAll of that led to me being in pain and unable to really lift my bike properly when I got to the barriers. Combined with the heavy mud on my bike from the climbing in another section of the course and my warmups had put me in a bad headspace (you can probably see it in the picture of me at the start line above).\nOn the first real lap, I freaked out at the second downhill and had to run down, holding up everyone behind me. It hurt so much and I felt so shitty. Despondent at my failure. When I got to the sand I ran it, but lifting my bike was an agony. Everything sucked and I was sure I would be getting my first DNF2 of my racing \u0026ldquo;career.\u0026rdquo;\nBut as things went on they got better. I balked at the downhill again, but the marshal at the top was encouraging even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t make my turn at the bottom. I rode the sand slowly but cleanly. I climbed in the mud. I saw Stew Hutchings3 out on the course and said I was having a bad day on the bike but it still beat working. On my last lap I made my downhill turn and rode the sand, and was passed by the bunch of teenagers who were up at the front of the race. Lifting my bike over the barriers sucked a lot, but I did it. I finished the race in pain but finished.\nSadly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling hanging out the rest of the day and there was no chili the way there had been the year before so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any great insight on how the rest of the day went. I do know that I could have done way better is I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been injured, but this kind of failure is part of racing and embracing the suck.\nresults\r#\rABA Results4 CrossResults Podia\r#\rOpen Women\r#\rNico KNOLL Christiane BILODEAU Alexandra VOLSTAD Open Men\r#\rRyan MACLEAN Eric BERG Graham FRANCIS Expert Men\r#\rLarix Hallett Luke PULFORD Adam ROBERTS Sport Women\r#\rDaena SIDNEY Sarah WELSH Hazel ROBERTS Sport Men\r#\rJack PURDY Josh BARKER Brendan CARDIFF5 Novice Men\r#\rWarren NISHIMURA6 Matthew TEEL William LEMIEUX my results\r#\r21st place (out of 27) 46:55 (lapped) read more\r#\rMy 2022 Experience at Puncheur Cross At the start line - photo by Stewart \u0026ldquo;The Legend\u0026rdquo; Hutchings\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDNF = \u0026ldquo;Did Not Finish\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Legend.

In cross you\u0026rsquo;re often racing in bad weather, cold weather, slippery weather. The courses are designed to make it hard for you to go quickly, not like a road bike race.

If I hope for great weather and for everything to go really well, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of room for disappointment. If things suck then embrace it. Know that this is how it is and work with it.

I hated the downhill that someone broke a collarbone on last year and lost so much time on it. Capilano Park was near my house and I could practice on it. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t practice hard enough on wet enough grass, because hoo boy did I not do well on that terrain.\n1\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like much there, but that grass was really dewy and for me that was tricky doing the turning back up a hill after going down it. Right after the start line there was a steep uphill, then three of these down and ups. Oof. I wiped out in the first uphill and then had trouble clipping back in and by then I was way back from following my benchmark rival.\n2\nAs the laps went on and we spread out it was better. I liked the course apart from those slippy down and ups. I shouldered my bike for the runups and even managed to navigate a bad hairpin fairly successfully 3/5 of the laps.

I\u0026rsquo;m not a big powerful rider pushing massive watts. I fall over a lot riding around on rough terrain.

I feel exhausted at the end of a race but I want to do it again.\nIt probably helps that we\u0026rsquo;ve had warm autumns since I started trying this out, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t been doing the bitter shivering or sliding down icy off-cambers.\nIn the offseason I started compiling the Alberta Cyclo-cross Cup race results into a spreadsheet to get a better sense of who the racers are. Like, in 2022 I had a nemesis in the races. How did he do in the races I didn\u0026rsquo;t enter? Getting all the data in one place seemed useful. So I built a Google Sheet. And then I learned about crossresults.com and revamped my results to get them into a place for the wider North American scene (which also does fancier things than my little csv could handle).\nThe other thing I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do this year is become a bit more social in the bike world. I\u0026rsquo;m in a cycling club now so I will have people wearing the same shirt as me at races. CX is supposed to be a social kind of experience3. In Belgium they cheer and crowd in for races and drink loads of beer and make lots of noise. Edmonton (and Devon) is the only place I\u0026rsquo;ve raced and Central Alberta\u0026rsquo;s a lot more sedate.

After all, who is to say that the participation award from your grade 4 track meet isn\u0026rsquo;t what made you the professional you are today?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve totally done it though. I called myself award-winning in the bio for a talk Jason and I gave at the Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference a few weeks ago, because I really did win an award for making radio back in journalism school. It seemed relevant as part of my radio librarian bona fides. But whatever.\nI worry about winning awards in librarianship. The things I tend to do are, while not designed to be high profile, a bit different from the standard librarian things. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t to say I don\u0026rsquo;t love the nuts \u0026amp; bolts kind of work of figuring out the answer to a tricky question - that\u0026rsquo;s the reason I librarian at all - but I\u0026rsquo;ve always always always wanted to do something different from what other people are doing rather than do what they\u0026rsquo;re doing better. So I see people who are amazeballs at storytime, bringing in huge crowds and getting all that awesome early learning stuff in there and I want to leave that to them and go do something else, like our radio show, or e-privacy workshop type stuff.\nWhich is fine and all. I get to do things I\u0026rsquo;m good at and let the people who are really good at the core libraryish things do them. But then I get twitchy about this because I\u0026rsquo;m basically just taking advantage of the novelty of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing to get recognition or whatever. It feels like an ego-stroke, a lot like going to the BC library conference is the only place in this world where I \u0026ldquo;know people\u0026rdquo; which can be weirdly ego-inflating. And then the people who are doing the really great normal librarian stuff get left out of the recognition party, which sucks.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want my flashy, kind-of-tangential-to-traditional-library-work projects to outshine my colleagues who are awesome in lower profile ways. Anyway yeah. Which is to say, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for self-promoting.\nI think what we\u0026rsquo;re doing with Librarians on the Radio is fun and a good use of my talents such as they are. We won a BCLA Merit award for it (well, our library did).

We were encouraged to put practical considerations aside, hence the \u0026ldquo;damn the lawyers; full speed ahead!\u0026rdquo; approach advocated within.\nMy big idea for public libraries is that they should embrace the role of \u0026ldquo;Your Friendly Neighbourhood Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy.\u0026rdquo; To begin, and to situate us here, I agree with R. David Lankes when he says \u0026ldquo;the mission of librarians is to facilitate knowledge creation in their communities.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a great mission, but I think it is very easy for us to mis-define our communities. I want my library (and this is a hypothetical library - I\u0026rsquo;m not representing anyone\u0026rsquo;s views but my own here) to serve the community it\u0026rsquo;s in and not the rules of publishers, movie studios or lawmakers.\nIn short, I want librarians to talk like pirates.\nSee, September 19th is \u0026ldquo;internet traditionally\u0026rdquo; known as International Talk Like a Pirate day. It\u0026rsquo;s a stupid internet thing, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pass up the connection. I want libraries to make it easier to share all sorts of electronic content and integrate better with how people actually use the internet. And that includes breaking all sorts of rules. I\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about collections, programming and philosophy for the next four minutes.\nFirst we\u0026rsquo;ve got the plunder of libraries, our collections. When we talk piracy I mean I want libraries to buy material and then share it as widely as possible instead of treating digital content like it\u0026rsquo;s physical. This is the kind of behaviour that content-providers don\u0026rsquo;t want from us so we are saddled with 26-checkouts-then-self-destruct kinds of ebooks or 3 downloaded songs per week.\nI want us to buy ebooks and crack the DRM on them so they can be used on any device. When we buy CDs/DVDs/Blu-Rays I want us to rip them to hard-drive arrays and seed the torrents ourselves. If we\u0026rsquo;re serious about \u0026ldquo;facilitating knowledge creation,\u0026rdquo; giving away electronic files is way more useful than making them hard to use. The picture here is of a PirateBox and a model of what I want libraries to encourage. In that PirateBox is a battery-powered WiFi router (you can see the antenna on the right) and a USB stick full of download-only media (there\u0026rsquo;s also the more library-specific project based on the Pirate Box called LibraryBox which is what my project would be more directly based on). You can put that anywhere and someone can connect to its network and get information, connecting local space with electronic content. I love these things. They\u0026rsquo;re the electronic equivalent of Little Free Libraries.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re here to talk about community. One of the things about internet media piracy is the isolation aspect of it. We know we\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to be downloading complete seasons of Clone Wars and feel a little ashamed, doing it by ourselves in the dark. When I show people how easy it is to make their Kindle books readable on a Kobo, or strip the stuff from digital library content that returns it, people are amazed. We\u0026rsquo;re taught that we have to follow the rules, but when you talk about breaking the rules, you\u0026rsquo;re engaging people with a different kind of illicit connection. I want the library to be a place where you can talk about this stuff freely, that it\u0026rsquo;s not some back-alley of information usage you should never mention to a fine upstanding librarian. I want librarians who are comfortable with 4chan and torrenting and can help their community members navigate some of those parts of the internet to have some fun or learn something or bring down an evil empire.\nAnd here I like the parallel to sex education. You can teach a pirated media abstinence only policy and let your members pick up their knowledge piecemeal (from downloading porn and getting viruses), or you can say \u0026ldquo;downloading TV shows is fun, and here\u0026rsquo;s how to do it safely, thoughtfully and have a better experience.\u0026rdquo; So my library project does programs teaching people about the processes and ethics of seeding and leeching torrents, about how to use Tor to hide what exactly you\u0026rsquo;re doing from people who might be of a mind to prosecute you, and using VPNs to get around location restrictions so we can watch shows on Hulu in Canada goddamnit.\nBecause I love the PirateBox thing we\u0026rsquo;d run workshops on how to build them and share their own content (stuff they\u0026rsquo;ve stolen or created themselves) outside of the library ecosystem. Because really, libraries aren\u0026rsquo;t the point here. We\u0026rsquo;re trying to facilitate knowledge creation, not pump up our circulation stats.\nEstablishing trust within your community that being an outlaw doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you a bad person plays into the whole idea that to live outside the law you must be honest. (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a Lego version of the Blonde on Blonde album cover, sorry.) When we teach our community about those tools people use to engage in piracy we also get to talk about intellectual property rights and why people do Creative Commons and privacy and all that good Electronic Frontier Foundation stuff. We get to discuss the difference between giving money to record labels versus supporting local artists. And we get to do this not from a position of on-high false moral rectitude but from down in the muck, in a \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re all in this together\u0026rdquo; kind of way. Loads of people aren\u0026rsquo;t going to buy media anyway, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the library can\u0026rsquo;t be a place to get them to share their knowledge.\nSo our final choice is to let people be bound by terrible rules koff koff Access Copyright enforced by publishing empires or we can become outlaws. At the opening gala last night Larry Beasley talked about how the law is a manifestation of us and we should be crafting new laws to build what we want.\nI think librarians should be allying themselves with the upstarts in their seedy cantinas who might do some crappy things and occasionally shoot first, but end up changing the galaxy.\nThank you very much.\n"}]
