<p>In Nanaimo there are comic and game shops I&rsquo;ll be able to bike to. The ferry to Vancouver is way closer and easier. I know a bunch of people there already (yes, most of them are librarians) so maybe I won&rsquo;t have to live on the internet quite so much.</p>
<p>Back when I decided to get an MLIS it was basically so I wouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in Winnipeg. And I&rsquo;m still not stuck anywhere, so it seems my mission is being accomplished. Go me.</p>
