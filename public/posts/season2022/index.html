    <p>I rode cyclocross races in 2022 but they didn&rsquo;t feel like cyclocross. They aren&rsquo;t muddy and cold<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Part of that was due to the boiling frog that we are as a planet but part of that is due to living in Edmonton, where we don&rsquo;t really get shoulder seasons. The abrupt floompf of winter that happened on November 2 starts fatbike season, not a time for racing in mud, like in Europe (or even Victoria, which is where the Canadian nationals are going to be happening in November).</p>
<p>When I entered my first cyclocross race in 2019, my partner and I were surprised at how sedate it was. Not the race itself, which I finished somewhere in the middle of<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but the cheering. We&rsquo;d somehow imbibed the notion that cyclocross races are loud and crazy with people banging cowbells all the livelong day. So we brought noisemakers for our toddler but it was a lot more spread out and low key than the internet might have had you believe. Biking around the course looking for my partner and kid afterwards I hit a pothole and whacked my shin on my pedal, leaving a scar I still have.</p>
<p>But that was a lone race. I had enjoyed it but when I was thinking I&rsquo;d do more the next year, COVID-19 hit and everything went to hell. So come 2022 I was ready to try again.</p>
<p>I bought a Citizen Racing License (good for Alberta only) and determined to enter three races to make it worth while (you can do 2 races on Single Event Licenses here which would have been cheaper). And I did enter these races. And it was fun.</p>
<p>Before the cyclocross season I entered the <a href="../stiedaclassic2022">Alex Stieda Classic</a> which was less of my thing. I mean, I enjoyed the ride but coming in last with a knee that felt like it was dying wasn&rsquo;t my favourite. Cyclocross is short and doesn&rsquo;t involve a long limp home if my body failed me.</p>
<p>As far as a season goes I didn&rsquo;t do a long one. One race per local weekend. It worked out to 4 with <a href="../tubsontubs2022">Tubs on Tubs</a>, the <a href="../jimhornergrandprix2022">Jim Horner Grand Prix</a>, <a href="../puncheurcross2022">Devon Puncheur Cross</a> and <a href="../zombiebabywaltercross2022">Zombie Baby Walter Cross</a>.</p>
