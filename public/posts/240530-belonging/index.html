    <p>This week I&rsquo;ve had some good rides. There was the <a href="../vcc/">Velocity</a> social ride last Saturday in which I risked going with the fast group and I did not die. I was not the fastest in that group and I was working hard, but it went pretty well. It was my second fastest time for 50k.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to both the (uncancelled) <a href="../ftt/">Fat Tire Tuesday</a> races down in <a href="../terwillegarpark/">Terwillegar park</a> and have been very slow on my mountain bike. I do tend to prefer riding that bike for the joy of movement rather than pushing pushing pushing myself, but it&rsquo;s a good non-comfort-zone kind of experience. And getting smoked by teenagers gives me good practice for the <a href="../cx/">cyclocross</a> season.</p>
<p>Then Wednesday I did a hills ride<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with a couple of the Velocity guys, and this morning I did a solo gravel/singletrack ride on my &lsquo;cross bike.</p>
<p>Through all of these I wore one of my jerseys indicating I was part of a club. The last time I wore an actual jersey to do a sport, I was 7. But it&rsquo;s funny how much it helps actually ease me into the social aspects of these things. &ldquo;We are both wearing funny shorts and bright red shirts! Let&rsquo;s share our common interests!&rdquo; The fact that we were a bunch of people preparing to ride our bikes in a time trial<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> on a night there was an Oilers game on, differentiated us from other people in our city and helped us draw together and laugh about our weird priorities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do belonging really well. These loose ties that make up a society haven&rsquo;t been something I&rsquo;ve really emphasized in my life before. Sort of disdained group think and the groups that lead that way. But now I&rsquo;m in a city where my close friends aren&rsquo;t and it really helps to have an in with strangers, who become acquaintances and might become friends.</p>
<p>And they aren&rsquo;t librarians (which has been my main source of new social circles the past decade and a half)!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what it sounds like. You ride to the bottom of some steep hills to ride up and then back down again. You do it a few times and it hurts. But I find it even more social than the social ride because we all stop to chat at the bottom since you don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> want to climb again.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>A time trial is a race against the clock. You don&rsquo;t start off with a group and you aren&rsquo;t supposed to draft off of other people if you get near them. The race is purely &ldquo;who gets across the line in the shortest time&rdquo; without the tactical games a group race uses.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
