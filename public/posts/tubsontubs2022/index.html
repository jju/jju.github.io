    <p>I returned to <a href="../../bike/cx/">cyclocross</a> in 2022, and went back to the same race in the same park. I&rsquo;m not sure if that makes this a classic or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d tested this course beforehand. My house is just across the river from the &ldquo;indestructible <a href="../../bike/strathconasciencepark/">Strathcona Science Park</a>&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> so this was where I&rsquo;d been riding up and down hills and practicing my off-cambers the week before (see <a href="https://flic.kr/p/2nHsYvQ">my idyllic practice image</a>).</p>
<p>In the tech guide the organizers had released it looked like the really super-steep downhill I&rsquo;d wiped out on in my practice laps back in 2019 was not part of the course, which I appreciated. I knew that going downhill and turning back up was not my strongest skill, but also that I could power up the climbs at a decent pace. I was ready.</p>
<p>I was lined up in the back row, having no ranking to speak of. The starting chute was a bit different than I&rsquo;d remembered it (closer to the finish and centre of action<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) and we got to hit barriers right away after some rootiness. The practice wasn&rsquo;t good enough to launch me off the front of the race but I turned my pedals and didn&rsquo;t get caught up in any of the twistiness. At the points where we had a couple of steep climbs (one on a gravel road and the other straight up a grassy hill) I was able to pass riders. I remembered how much fun this all was.</p>
<p>Through most of the race I was chasing a rider named <a href="https://www.crossresults.com/racer/216990">Arun Ward</a>. I remembered his name because he was called up in the front row, so seeing him as the wheel in front of me gave me confidence. &ldquo;How close to the front am I?&rdquo; I followed him around and saw his tubeless tire burp in a pothole. Having someone to chase made me ride better, except when I followed him high on an off-camber. Now I realize my tire pressure should have been lower to get better grip on that but I wiped out on one of my middle laps. And then again on the last lap, cussing. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be so vociferous but I couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>By the end of the race I was just a little behind Ward but I had no idea how many people were ahead of him. My partner thought I was 7th or so, but in the end she&rsquo;d missed seeing the front group and I was only 11th.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> There was a small group of us older guys who&rsquo;d finished near each other and we chatted about how I seemed to be doing better but then crashed out a few times. Ward asked if I was going to be racing the next day and I wasn&rsquo;t, but hoo boy did I want to.</p>

<p>So described in the tech guide. I assume that one year they must have destroyed this place with a CX race.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Which was good because my partner and kid didn&rsquo;t get there in time to take my backpack with race gear so I had to leave it lying on the ground while I raced and have faith in the goodness of &lsquo;crossers.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It actually took a number of weeks for my result to be recognized by the Alberta Bicycle Association, during which time I was mistakenly listed as a DNF.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
