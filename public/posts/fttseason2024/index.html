    <p>For me, mountain bike racing is not something I&rsquo;m super into, so I wouldn&rsquo;t pay much to do it like I do <a href="../cx/">cyclocross</a>, but the <a href="../ftt/">Fat Tire Tuesday</a> races had always looked like fun so in 2024 I took the plunge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Race 1</strong> 2024-05-14: <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/37005832">stravalink</a> Started off with steep uphill on rocky surface. I got caught behind a couple of riders who went way slower than I could have, putting me in a hole the rest of the race. I was chasing a Hardcore Bike Club rider for most of the rest of the race. I gained time on the ups; he gained time everywhere else. There was one descent that was steep, kind of muddy and had a turn into a bridge right at the bottom. I had a tough time with it on my practice lap and managed to wipe out on it in Lap 2 (I&rsquo;m a B-Group rider so I only did 3 laps).
<ul>
<li>5/6 for 6 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Race 2</strong> 2024-05-28<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> : <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/37005757">stravalink</a> There was a prologue to stretch the group out a little before hitting the singletrack this week. Loads of climbing on this course. I was following one rider for most of the first lap before a pedal strike knocked me to a halt and my lost momentum meant I didn&rsquo;t see her again until the last third of the third lap. The rooty climb was tough, and I messed up the line on lap 2. In the end I was lapped by a <strong>lot</strong> of the fast group riders (by two of them in lap 2).
<ul>
<li>9/10 for 2 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Race 3</strong> 2024-06-18<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> : <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/37144430">stravalink</a> The organizers made this a shorter loop because the Oilers were playing a must-win game in the Stanley Cup Final, so they wanted us to get out of there quickly. I was chasing another B-group rider on the second lap who, when she passed me said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;m slow on the downhills.&rdquo; So as she was opening more of a gap going down I tried to go faster and then a moment of inattention meant I clipped my bars on a tree and crashed. It hurt. I finished the race, but never did catch up with her.
<ul>
<li>4/6 for 7 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Race 4</strong> 2024-06-25: <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/37193026">stravalink</a> This was pretty much the same course as the first FTT race of the year (although for some reason, the segment says it&rsquo;s longer). I wiped out on that same off-camber descent I had trouble with in May, but managed to hang onto 2nd place in the B-Group nonetheless. Climbing is definitely where I gain a bit of time in these races.
<ul>
<li>2/4 for 9 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Race 5</strong> 2024-07-02: Missed the race because of my kid&rsquo;s soccer game. They had a Le Mans style start<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> though, which sounded fun.</li>
<li><strong>Race 6</strong> 2024-07-09: Missed the race because I was in Valemount doing a little mountain biking. This was a team trivia race, and I have no idea how that works.</li>
