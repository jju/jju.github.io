      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m riding my bike again. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months off dealing with some other issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m making my legs go &amp;lsquo;round in circles again. The big difference compared with last winter is that I&amp;rsquo;m riding indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got a Wahoo smart trainer in fall when the &lt;a href=&#34;../../tags/cx/&#34;&gt;cyclocross&lt;/a&gt; season was getting smoked out and it was dangerous to go outside and breathe heavily. It was heavily on sale because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a full-on smart trainer that replaces your rear wheel and has a computer out front built in. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind that rolls against your rear tire&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote class=&#39;book-hint &#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is a slightly modified version of the text (and slides) from my talk at Oh, the Places You&amp;rsquo;ll Know, a part of SFU&amp;rsquo;s Public Square on September 19, 2012. We were encouraged to put practical considerations aside, hence the &amp;ldquo;damn the lawyers; full speed ahead!&amp;rdquo; approach advocated within.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My big idea for public libraries is that they should embrace the role of &amp;ldquo;Your Friendly Neighbourhood Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy.&amp;rdquo; To begin, and to situate us here, I agree with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newlibrarianship.org/&#34; title=&#34;The Atlas of New Librarianship&#34;&gt;R. David Lankes&lt;/a&gt; when he says &amp;ldquo;the mission of librarians is to facilitate knowledge creation in their communities.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a great mission, but I think it is very easy for us to mis-define our communities. I want my library (and this is a hypothetical library - I&amp;rsquo;m not representing anyone&amp;rsquo;s views but my own here) to serve the community it&amp;rsquo;s in and not the rules of publishers, movie studios or lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
