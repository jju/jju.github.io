      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m riding my bike again. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months off dealing with some other issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m making my legs go &amp;lsquo;round in circles again. The big difference compared with last winter is that I&amp;rsquo;m riding indoors.&#xA;I got a Wahoo smart trainer in fall when the cyclocross season was getting smoked out and it was dangerous to go outside and breathe heavily. It was heavily on sale because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a full-on smart trainer that replaces your rear wheel and has a computer out front built in.</description>

      <description>This is a slightly modified version of the text (and slides) from my talk at Oh, the Places You&amp;rsquo;ll Know, a part of SFU&amp;rsquo;s Public Square on September 19, 2012. We were encouraged to put practical considerations aside, hence the &amp;ldquo;damn the lawyers; full speed ahead!&amp;rdquo; approach advocated within.&#xA;My big idea for public libraries is that they should embrace the role of &amp;ldquo;Your Friendly Neighbourhood Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy.</description>
