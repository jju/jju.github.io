      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;a cycling club&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 and we have a coach. I have never had a coach before. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever really done sports so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what a coach is supposed to do. But Kevin seems earnest and nice and is trying so hard to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before this season&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;../stiedaclassic2023/&#34;&gt;first race&lt;/a&gt; he held a racers&amp;rsquo; meeting to go over the course using veloviewer and to talk about tactics and what we should be doing before a race. I was at work that night, so I asked if he&amp;rsquo;d be able to record it and he did. He talked about wind directions and planning and prep and where to attack the group if we had the legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
