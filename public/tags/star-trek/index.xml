      <description>It has been years since Star Trek was really important to me. Decades. When I was a teen The Next Generation was (along with the Simpsons and the X-Files) the fiction I loved most. I loved the stories; I loved the vision of the future; most of all I loved the characters and could think of nothing better than flying around having adventures solving problems with a found family1. That&amp;rsquo;s still something I love the idea of, and pretty much is my mental model of what I wanted out of a working life.</description>
