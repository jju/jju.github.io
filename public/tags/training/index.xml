It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months off dealing with some other issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m making my legs go &amp;lsquo;round in circles again. The big difference compared with last winter is that I&amp;rsquo;m riding indoors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got a Wahoo smart trainer in fall when the &lt;a href="../../tags/cx/">cyclocross&lt;/a> season was getting smoked out and it was dangerous to go outside and breathe heavily. It was heavily on sale because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a full-on smart trainer that replaces your rear wheel and has a computer out front built in. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind that rolls against your rear tire&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>scars</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/231017-scars/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/231017-scars/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my first cyclocross race I was riding around afterwards and hit a pothole in &lt;a href="../strathconasciencepark/">Strathcona Science Park&lt;/a> whacking my right ankle on my pedal and gouging a chunk out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Training for my 2023 cx season I slipped my right foot and gouged my ankle on my big ring. This one probably could have used stitches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Half a week before entering the &lt;a href="../hopnhurl2023/">Hop n Hurl race&lt;/a> I was cruising downhill to &lt;a href="../capilanopark/">Capilano Park&lt;/a> for some good cx practice. The offroad downhill goes into Rundle park and is called &lt;a href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/get-ready-to-rundle-60390/">get ready to rundle&lt;/a> on TrailForks. I was descending on the hoods, not in the drops and I guess my weight wasn&amp;rsquo;t far enough back so when I hit the hard rut and my front wheel turned I went over the bars. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hit my head but got my knees, hip, wrist and ribs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hardcore hop n hurl 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I came into this race knowing that last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../puncheurcross2022/">Puncheur Cross&lt;/a> was my favourite. Unfortunately I had &lt;a href="../231017-scars/">a training crash&lt;/a> the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>embrace the suck</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/230919-embrace-the-suck/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/230919-embrace-the-suck/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Embrace the suck&amp;rdquo;[^1]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a &lt;a href="../cx/">cx&lt;/a> rider this ethos means a lot. In cross you&amp;rsquo;re often racing in bad weather, cold weather, slippery weather. The courses are designed to make it hard for you to go quickly, not like a road bike race. All the twists and turns and lack of traction can make it so the fast people don&amp;rsquo;t get to use their speed, and craftiness, technique comes to the fore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>midweek racing</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/wnw2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/wnw2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of my &lt;a href="../230829-prepping-a-season/">season preparations&lt;/a> I decided to at least try the midweek &lt;a href="../cx/">cx&lt;/a> racing that goes on in Edmonton. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird because it&amp;rsquo;s so casual and hard to find information about. There are people asking questions in the Alberta CX Facebook group and you get a response with a screenshot from somewhere(?) giving a schedule. It seems that the people who know, know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And holy crap did a lot of people know about it last night!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>preparing for a season</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/230829-prepping-a-season/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/230829-prepping-a-season/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Alberta Bicycle Association Cyclo-cross Cup begins this weekend with the &lt;a href="../tubsontubs2023/">Tubs on Tubs&lt;/a> race and the &lt;a href="../velocitycross2023/">Velocity CX&lt;/a> and I am excited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These races take place at &lt;a href="../strathconasciencepark">Strathcona Science Park&lt;/a>, which is a five minute ride from my house, so it&amp;rsquo;s my closest thing to a &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; race and where I do most of my ripping around on grass to practice &amp;lsquo;crossing. The other day I was out there and saw someone else also riding around on the grass and flagged her down. Turned out she was one of the race organizers planning out the course.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>go team optimism</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/230530-coaching/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/230530-coaching/</guid><description>&lt;p>I joined &lt;a href="../vcc/">a cycling club&lt;/a> in 2023 and we have a coach. I have never had a coach before. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever really done sports so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what a coach is supposed to do. But Kevin seems earnest and nice and is trying so hard to be helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before this season&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../stiedaclassic2023/">first race&lt;/a> he held a racers&amp;rsquo; meeting to go over the course using veloviewer and to talk about tactics and what we should be doing before a race. I was at work that night, so I asked if he&amp;rsquo;d be able to record it and he did. He talked about wind directions and planning and prep and where to attack the group if we had the legs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
