      <description>&amp;ldquo;You aren&amp;rsquo;t an athlete.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is what I hear when I ride my bike. It&amp;rsquo;s a frustrating thing to hear because it is true. I&amp;rsquo;m an old man, well, not old old, not the cool kind of old that you get props for just being out there riding, but the classic MAMIL1 with more money than the hungry kids who are out there riding for wins and improvement, selection for teams, the idea that they could make something, have something to show for their time out on the bike.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m riding my bike again. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months off dealing with some other issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m making my legs go &amp;lsquo;round in circles again. The big difference compared with last winter is that I&amp;rsquo;m riding indoors.&#xA;I got a Wahoo smart trainer in fall when the cyclocross season was getting smoked out and it was dangerous to go outside and breathe heavily. It was heavily on sale because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a full-on smart trainer that replaces your rear wheel and has a computer out front built in.</description>

      <description>Tech Guide&#xA;Location: Voyageur Park Devon&#xA;Course: stravalink&#xA;I came into this race knowing that last year&amp;rsquo;s Puncheur Cross was my favourite. Unfortunately I had a training crash the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.</description>
