The category being Citizen, which is supposed to be a mixed gender, less intense beginner kind of racing. The other guy, Keith, was also part of &lt;a href="../vcc/">my cycling club&lt;/a> but he said he was only in this class by mistake. He was confused and could probably have been in the Mens&amp;rsquo; Category 4. But there we were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did. I went the fastest I&amp;rsquo;d ever done 40km.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>stieda classic 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>My knee went pop in the last 7km of the ride and Mike who I&amp;rsquo;d been riding with left me behind. It was all right though. I was going to finish my first road race. And yes, I was slow, but that was okay.&lt;/p>
