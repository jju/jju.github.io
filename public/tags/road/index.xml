I&amp;rsquo;d been waiting on my race fee reimbursement before entering the &lt;a href=&#34;../stiedaclassic2023/&#34;&gt;Stieda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../stiedaclassic2022/&#34;&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; again, but that came kind of late. A couple of people from my club mentioned that since I&amp;rsquo;m a bit better climber than a big powerful guy, I might find Pigeon Lake more suitable. I debated a bunch, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>my 2023 season summary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2023 I was hoping to be a better racer. I spent the winter actually using the gym we have at work, doing time on the stationary bike so as not to lose all my kilometres in my legs. They say you should do strength training and I tried but it&amp;rsquo;s a pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I did was join a club. &lt;a href=&#34;https://velocitycyclingclub.ca&#34;&gt;Velocity Cycling Club&lt;/a&gt; is my new bunch. We have a coach and club jerseys and it&amp;rsquo;s all a bit more community-building than the lone-wolf cyclist thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. I went on a couple of group rides and they were fun. The first was about 60km and easy riding. I self-selected to the slow group, and was the only person in it (along with the bunch leader). But it was good. I got to learn about some of the group riding norms and hand signals. Old Paul was very welcoming in general and did a good job showing me how to get close to people in the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;a cycling club&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 and we have a coach. I have never had a coach before. I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever really done sports so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what a coach is supposed to do. But Kevin seems earnest and nice and is trying so hard to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before this season&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;../stiedaclassic2023/&#34;&gt;first race&lt;/a&gt; he held a racers&amp;rsquo; meeting to go over the course using veloviewer and to talk about tactics and what we should be doing before a race. I was at work that night, so I asked if he&amp;rsquo;d be able to record it and he did. He talked about wind directions and planning and prep and where to attack the group if we had the legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We only had two people in my category for this race. The category being Citizen, which is supposed to be a mixed gender, less intense beginner kind of racing. The other guy, Keith, was also part of &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;my cycling club&lt;/a&gt; but he said he was only in this class by mistake. He was confused and could probably have been in the Mens&amp;rsquo; Category 4. But there we were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did. I went the fastest I&amp;rsquo;d ever done 40km.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>bike racing season 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode cyclocross races in 2022 but they didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like cyclocross. They aren&amp;rsquo;t muddy and cold&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Part of that was due to the boiling frog that we are as a planet but part of that is due to living in Edmonton, where we don&amp;rsquo;t really get shoulder seasons. The abrupt floompf of winter that happened on November 2 starts fatbike season, not a time for racing in mud, like in Europe (or even Victoria, which is where the Canadian nationals are going to be happening in November).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My knee went pop in the last 7km of the ride and Mike who I&amp;rsquo;d been riding with left me behind. It was all right though. I was going to finish my first road race. And yes, I was slow, but that was okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  results&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#results&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;43rd place (out of 50 in Category 5)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Average Speed 27.72 km/h&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2:03:22 (2 Laps) 33:59 behind winner&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lap 1 49:32&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lap 2 1:13:49 (note that this lap was longer)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zone4.ca/race/2022-05-07/b8ae91b0/results/&#34;&gt;Zone 4 Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
