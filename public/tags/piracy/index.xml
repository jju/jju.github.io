 &lt;p>This is a slightly modified version of the text (and slides) from my talk at Oh, the Places You&amp;rsquo;ll Know, a part of SFU&amp;rsquo;s Public Square on September 19, 2012. We were encouraged to put practical considerations aside, hence the &amp;ldquo;damn the lawyers; full speed ahead!&amp;rdquo; approach advocated within.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>My big idea for public libraries is that they should embrace the role of &amp;ldquo;Your Friendly Neighbourhood Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy.&amp;rdquo; To begin, and to situate us here, I agree with &lt;a href="http://www.newlibrarianship.org/" title="The Atlas of New Librarianship">R. David Lankes&lt;/a> when he says &amp;ldquo;the mission of librarians is to facilitate knowledge creation in their communities.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a great mission, but I think it is very easy for us to mis-define our communities. I want my library (and this is a hypothetical library - I&amp;rsquo;m not representing anyone&amp;rsquo;s views but my own here) to serve the community it&amp;rsquo;s in and not the rules of publishers, movie studios or lawmakers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
