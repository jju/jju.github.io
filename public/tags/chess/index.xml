      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to focus a bit this past year. When I come home to a quiet house (four days a week) there are many things I could do. Watch shows, read books, cook interesting meals, go out and spend money being around people. But when I have all those options the tendency I have is to just kind of waste it. To work on that I&amp;rsquo;ve got three main things I&amp;rsquo;m working on filling my time with: bikes, books, and chess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
