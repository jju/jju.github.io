&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>The first time I &lt;a href="../puncheurcross2022">raced CX in Devon&lt;/a>, I loved it. &lt;a href="../hopnhurl2023/">Last year&lt;/a> I was injured beforehand so it turned out to be my worst race of the season, but it was still such a good course it was hard to really be down on it. This year I wasn&amp;rsquo;t hurt and just came in to have a good time.

&lt;p>Part of what makes Devon a fun course is the variety of terrain. Races at &lt;a href="../capilanopark/">Capilano&lt;/a> are grass grass grass (with a few roots on the 50m of singletrack), but at Voyageur Park you&amp;rsquo;ve got grass and dirt and pavement and a beach and sand, all in the leaves changing colour, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice. Different terrain also forces the racers into different choices. I was watching the Sport Men mostly from the sand pit while kibitzing with a few more experienced racers. There was a choice to make there over whether to try riding the sand or to pick up your bike and run. When I was watching most people were running it. I tried to ride it on my preride, but with the hairpin coming in, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it. If you could stay on, you&amp;rsquo;d have a better chance of also riding up the short uphill right after the pit, but more people I saw put their bikes down then rode up after smoother remounts than I&amp;rsquo;m capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hardcore hop n hurl 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I came into this race knowing that last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../puncheurcross2022/">Puncheur Cross&lt;/a> was my favourite. Unfortunately I had &lt;a href="../231017-scars/">a training crash&lt;/a> the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
