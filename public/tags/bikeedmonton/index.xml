      <description>&lt;p&gt;The summer is almost done and I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this site in ages. But that is okay. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with not having written. Really and truly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year I haven&amp;rsquo;t biked as much as I did last year. Part of that is because I&amp;rsquo;ve started volunteering once a week at &lt;a href=&#34;https://bikeedmonton.ca/&#34;&gt;Bike Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;, which takes up time. Part of it is just being tired, and demoralized for being slow. I took up the mantle of Mountain Bike representative for &lt;a href=&#34;VCC.md&#34;&gt;VCC&lt;/a&gt; which meant I missed a few &lt;a href=&#34;ftt.md&#34;&gt;ftt&lt;/a&gt; races riding alone in &lt;a href=&#34;capilanopark.md&#34;&gt;capilanopark&lt;/a&gt; instead. When I did get in a couple of races, I was oh so slow, even though I worked so hard. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it out to the good mountain biking at all this summer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t ride to work as much as I wanted. Just generally a blah kind of year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
