      <description>&lt;p&gt;My second race of the &lt;a href=&#34;../cxseason2022/&#34;&gt;2022 cyclocross season&lt;/a&gt; was presented by the Juventus Cycling Club at  the Argyll Velodrome. Not in the velodrome itself, but the park surrounding it. When I was looking at the map in the preceding days I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where the ups and downs and how it would work as a course. There was a toboggan hill. Were we going to have to up that? Down it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
