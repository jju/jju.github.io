      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve had some good rides. There was the &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; social ride last Saturday in which I risked going with the fast group and I did not die. I was not the fastest in that group and I was working hard, but it went pretty well. It was my second fastest time for 50k.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to both the (uncancelled) &lt;a href=&#34;../ftt/&#34;&gt;Fat Tire Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; races down in &lt;a href=&#34;../terwillegarpark/&#34;&gt;Terwillegar park&lt;/a&gt; and have been very slow on my mountain bike. I do tend to prefer riding that bike for the joy of movement rather than pushing pushing pushing myself, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good non-comfort-zone kind of experience. And getting smoked by teenagers gives me good practice for the &lt;a href=&#34;../cx/&#34;&gt;cyclocross&lt;/a&gt; season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
