There was the &lt;a href="../vcc/">Velocity&lt;/a> social ride last Saturday in which I risked going with the fast group and I did not die. I was not the fastest in that group and I was working hard, but it went pretty well. It was my second fastest time for 50k.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been to both the (uncancelled) &lt;a href="../ftt/">Fat Tire Tuesday&lt;/a> races down in &lt;a href="../terwillegarpark/">Terwillegar park&lt;/a> and have been very slow on my mountain bike. I do tend to prefer riding that bike for the joy of movement rather than pushing pushing pushing myself, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good non-comfort-zone kind of experience. And getting smoked by teenagers gives me good practice for the &lt;a href="../cx/">cyclocross&lt;/a> season.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
