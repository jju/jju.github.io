&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I had hoped to do more racing this year, but it turned out that four was what I could handle with my work and other life commitments. So the second day of Baby Walter Cross was my season closer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The course this year went the opposite direction of &lt;a href="../zombiebabywaltercross2022/">2022&lt;/a> which I think I preferred. The climbing of the stupid hill was still tough, but the descents weren&amp;rsquo;t terrifying and we got to skip the runup in favour of a singletrack descent (with roots that were highlighted but you needed to dodge).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>baby walter cross 2023 - day 1</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2023-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2023-1/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>Baby Walter Cross is a two-day race put on by the Alberta Cyclocross Collective, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a club exactly, just all the &lt;a href="../cx/">cx&lt;/a> lovers in Edmonton. The park has a really big hill, which makes for a lot of climbing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently on the Saturday race (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend) there were some big crashes by people trying to bunny-hop the obstacles and failing badly. One of them happened when the rider came unclipped between barriers, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think there were too huge of injuries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>zombie baby walter cross 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was the last competitor across the line in the Novice class of the Zombie Baby Walter Cross race. But a bunch of people had been lapped or did not finish, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually in last place. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how that feels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not so funny how it feels to wipe out trying to turn while sliding down a grassy hill. Which I did. But I kept going, gritting my teeth while kids in my race were bunny-hopping the barriers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
