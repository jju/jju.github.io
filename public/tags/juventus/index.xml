&lt;p>The Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well. Unlike last year we had clear skies with no Air Quality warnings so all the races happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being in Novice Men, I had an early start while the grass was still dewy and wet. The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it). I did that switchback okay in practice, but on the opening lap I totally wiped out, delaying a bunch of people behind me. Once that was out of the way though, I had a good race. I was following some people and eventually passed them. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get in touch with the leaders of the race but I had a pretty good run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>jim horner grand prix 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I was so happy this race wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking place in &lt;a href="../argyllpark/">Argyll Park&lt;/a> this year. I hated the downhill that someone broke a collarbone on last year and lost so much time on it. &lt;a href="../capilanopark/">Capilano Park&lt;/a> was near my house and I could practice on it. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t practice hard enough on wet enough grass, because hoo boy did I not do well on that terrain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>stieda classic 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>We only had two people in my category for this race. The category being Citizen, which is supposed to be a mixed gender, less intense beginner kind of racing. The other guy, Keith, was also part of &lt;a href="../vcc/">my cycling club&lt;/a> but he said he was only in this class by mistake. He was confused and could probably have been in the Mens&amp;rsquo; Category 4. But there we were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did. I went the fastest I&amp;rsquo;d ever done 40km.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>jim horner grand prix 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>My second race of the &lt;a href="../cxseason2022/">2022 cyclocross season&lt;/a> was presented by the Juventus Cycling Club at the Argyll Velodrome. Not in the velodrome itself, but the park surrounding it. When I was looking at the map in the preceding days I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where the ups and downs and how it would work as a course. There was a toboggan hill. Were we going to have to up that? Down it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>stieda classic 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>My knee went pop in the last 7km of the ride and Mike who I&amp;rsquo;d been riding with left me behind. It was all right though. I was going to finish my first road race. And yes, I was slow, but that was okay.&lt;/p>
