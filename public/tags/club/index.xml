      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve had some good rides. There was the &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; social ride last Saturday in which I risked going with the fast group and I did not die. I was not the fastest in that group and I was working hard, but it went pretty well. It was my second fastest time for 50k.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to both the (uncancelled) &lt;a href=&#34;../ftt/&#34;&gt;Fat Tire Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; races down in &lt;a href=&#34;../terwillegarpark/&#34;&gt;Terwillegar park&lt;/a&gt; and have been very slow on my mountain bike. I do tend to prefer riding that bike for the joy of movement rather than pushing pushing pushing myself, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good non-comfort-zone kind of experience. And getting smoked by teenagers gives me good practice for the &lt;a href=&#34;../cx/&#34;&gt;cyclocross&lt;/a&gt; season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is almost the end of April in 2024 and my Strava account says I&amp;rsquo;m in better shape than I was at any point last year. I&amp;rsquo;ve been out for a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;../vcc/&#34;&gt;VCC&lt;/a&gt; rides this season where it&amp;rsquo;s been about 11 degrees and I wore my tights and seemed to fit in pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first week there was a fast group and a slow group, which I definitely knew I should stick with (Strava number notwithstanding). My suspicions were justified the next week when chatting with one of the riders who&amp;rsquo;d been in the first week fast group. Apparently their average speed wasn&amp;rsquo;t that crazy, but they&amp;rsquo;re so strong in the wind. Some of them used to be Cat 1&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; racers so yeah, best shape of my life is still going to leave me in a puddle by the side of the road keeping up with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://velocitycyclingclub.ca&#34;&gt;Velocity Cycling Club&lt;/a&gt; is the group I ride with. There are a few clubs in the Edmonton area that I could have joined. I was going to join &lt;a href=&#34;https://ertc.org/&#34;&gt;ERTC (Edmonton Road and Track Club)&lt;/a&gt; back in 2020 but doing things in groups wasn&amp;rsquo;t feasible that year. I ended up with VCC mostly because a couple of the older guys from their club were friendly at a few of my &lt;a href=&#34;cxseason2022.md&#34;&gt;2022 cyclocross races&lt;/a&gt;. Also, nice jerseys without extraneous advertising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
