      <description>&amp;ldquo;You aren&amp;rsquo;t an athlete.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is what I hear when I ride my bike. It&amp;rsquo;s a frustrating thing to hear because it is true. I&amp;rsquo;m an old man, well, not old old, not the cool kind of old that you get props for just being out there riding, but the classic MAMIL1 with more money than the hungry kids who are out there riding for wins and improvement, selection for teams, the idea that they could make something, have something to show for their time out on the bike.</description>

      <description>In my first cyclocross race I was riding around afterwards and hit a pothole in Strathcona Science Park whacking my right ankle on my pedal and gouging a chunk out of it.&#xA;Training for my 2023 cx season I slipped my right foot and gouged my ankle on my big ring. This one probably could have used stitches.&#xA;Half a week before entering the Hop n Hurl race I was cruising downhill to Capilano Park for some good cx practice.</description>
