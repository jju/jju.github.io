&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>
 &lt;p>Images which idealize (like most fashion and animal photography) are no less aggressive than work which makes a virtue of plainness (like class pictures, still lifes of the bleaker sort, and mug shots). There is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>On Photography&lt;/em> - Susan Sontag&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I take pictures of my kid every day almost. He&amp;rsquo;s young; this kind of behaviour is expected. I do it now because when he ages into being able to give consent he might not want me to. Will he see this as aggression? I do my best to not be controlling in how I steal pictures from people (inanimate objects are different, but not landscapes I realize), but will he resist my aggression, gentle as I try to make it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>winning awards</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/150601-winning-awards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 17:26:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/150601-winning-awards/</guid><description>&lt;p>Around our workplace there&amp;rsquo;s a joke that we should all be putting &amp;ldquo;award-winning librarian&amp;rdquo; in our bios when we show up in the outside world. After all, who is to say that the participation award from your grade 4 track meet isn&amp;rsquo;t what made you the professional you are today?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve totally done it though. I called myself award-winning in the bio for a talk Jason and I gave at the Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference a few weeks ago, because I really did win an award for making radio back in journalism school. It seemed relevant as part of my radio librarian bona fides. But whatever.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
