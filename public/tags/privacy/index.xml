      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-agression&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  on agression&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#on-agression&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#39;book-hint &#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Images which idealize (like most fashion and animal photography) are no less aggressive than work which makes a virtue of plainness (like class pictures, still lifes of the bleaker sort, and mug shots). There is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Photography&lt;/em&gt; - Susan Sontag&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take pictures of my kid every day almost. He&amp;rsquo;s young; this kind of behaviour is expected. I do it now because when he ages into being able to give consent he might not want me to. Will he see this as aggression? I do my best to not be controlling in how I steal pictures from people (inanimate objects are different, but not landscapes I realize), but will he resist my aggression, gentle as I try to make it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>winning awards</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around our workplace there&amp;rsquo;s a joke that we should all be putting &amp;ldquo;award-winning librarian&amp;rdquo; in our bios when we show up in the outside world. After all, who is to say that the participation award from your grade 4 track meet isn&amp;rsquo;t what made you the professional you are today?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve totally done it though. I called myself award-winning in the bio for a talk Jason and I gave at the Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference a few weeks ago, because I really did win an award for making radio back in journalism school. It seemed relevant as part of my radio librarian bona fides. But whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
