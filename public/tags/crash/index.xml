&lt;p>Training for my 2023 cx season I slipped my right foot and gouged my ankle on my big ring. This one probably could have used stitches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Half a week before entering the &lt;a href="../hopnhurl2023/">Hop n Hurl race&lt;/a> I was cruising downhill to &lt;a href="../capilanopark/">Capilano Park&lt;/a> for some good cx practice. The offroad downhill goes into Rundle park and is called &lt;a href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/get-ready-to-rundle-60390/">get ready to rundle&lt;/a> on TrailForks. I was descending on the hoods, not in the drops and I guess my weight wasn&amp;rsquo;t far enough back so when I hit the hard rut and my front wheel turned I went over the bars. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hit my head but got my knees, hip, wrist and ribs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hardcore hop n hurl 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I came into this race knowing that last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../puncheurcross2022/">Puncheur Cross&lt;/a> was my favourite. Unfortunately I had &lt;a href="../231017-scars/">a training crash&lt;/a> the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
