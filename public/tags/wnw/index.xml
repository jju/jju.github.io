      <description>The cyclocross season starts in September for us in Edmonton. Some years we&amp;rsquo;ve (apparently) had snow right for the first races. There are kind of three aspects to the season for me. A bunch of training, the casual races and the sanctioned Alberta Cup races.&#xA;Training is training. I ride up and down hills and in parks.&#xA;Wednesday Night Worlds Much like the Fat Tire Tuesday races, Edmonton has a series of $5 cx races in &amp;lsquo;cross season.</description>
