      <description>At the end of 2022 I began actually watching cyclocross races. My kid still had &amp;ldquo;naps&amp;rdquo; on days when he wasn&amp;rsquo;t at school and I discovered that YouTube could show me what had been going on in Belgium that morning. It was &amp;lsquo;kerstperiode&amp;rsquo;1 so there were a pile of races to get thoroughly immersed in. I&amp;rsquo;d watch most of a race and then get the final lap queued up for when C could come out of his room and we would watch 15 minutes of muddy bike racing.</description>
