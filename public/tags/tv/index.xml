      <description>It has been years since Star Trek was really important to me. Decades. When I was a teen The Next Generation was (along with the Simpsons and the X-Files) the fiction I loved most. I loved the stories; I loved the vision of the future; most of all I loved the characters and could think of nothing better than flying around having adventures solving problems with a found family1. That&amp;rsquo;s still something I love the idea of, and pretty much is my mental model of what I wanted out of a working life.</description>

      <description>At the end of 2022 I began actually watching cyclocross races. My kid still had &amp;ldquo;naps&amp;rdquo; on days when he wasn&amp;rsquo;t at school and I discovered that YouTube could show me what had been going on in Belgium that morning. It was &amp;lsquo;kerstperiode&amp;rsquo;1 so there were a pile of races to get thoroughly immersed in. I&amp;rsquo;d watch most of a race and then get the final lap queued up for when C could come out of his room and we would watch 15 minutes of muddy bike racing.</description>
