Some years we&amp;rsquo;ve (apparently) had snow right for the first races. There are kind of three aspects to the season for me. A bunch of training, the casual races and the sanctioned Alberta Cup races.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Training is training. I ride up and down hills and in parks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Much like the &lt;a href="../ftt/">Fat Tire Tuesday&lt;/a> races, Edmonton has a series of $5 cx races in &amp;lsquo;cross season. The A group starts a minute before the B group which starts a minute before the C group and everyone races for about 25 minutes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>school of cross 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schoolofcross2024/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/schoolofcross2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>Part two of the first Edmonton race weekend saw way more people (in my race at least). The course went backwards compared to &lt;a href="../jimhornergrandprix2024/">Jim Horner&lt;/a> the previous day. This was good for me because it meant we had a non-technical climb right after the start, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m pretty decent at. It also meant that the switchbacks we&amp;rsquo;d been climbing on Saturday were now a descent. I&amp;rsquo;m never super great at these kinds of things and in the pre-ride lots of people were testing and re-testing the lines&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. After one wipeout when I was trying to cut it too close, I settled on unclipping my inside foot and dabbing a touch as I went around the steepest part. The best part of this feature was that it would be at the end of the lap so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a huge mass of riders hitting it at the same time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>jim horner grand prix 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;p>The Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well. Unlike last year we had clear skies with no Air Quality warnings so all the races happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being in Novice Men, I had an early start while the grass was still dewy and wet. The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it). I did that switchback okay in practice, but on the opening lap I totally wiped out, delaying a bunch of people behind me. Once that was out of the way though, I had a good race. I was following some people and eventually passed them. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get in touch with the leaders of the race but I had a pretty good run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>pigeon lake road race 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pigeonlake2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/pigeonlake2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

I was not the fastest in that group and I was working hard, but it went pretty well. It was my second fastest time for 50k.&lt;/p>

In 2024, all the races are happening at &lt;a href="../terwillegarpark">Terwillegar park&lt;/a>. The races cost $5 and you can enter in three categories (the fastest do 4 laps, the slower people do 3 laps and the slowest only do 2). There&amp;rsquo;s a point structure and a &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/1042773">group on Strava&lt;/a> where the news of race results/cancellations happen.&lt;/p>

It has a pile of trails and is a great off-leash area for doggos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of doubletrack that follows along by the river and countless little ins and out singletrack bits through the trees. One of the downsides of the park is that the soil is very clay-based so it gets super rutty if people ride it before letting it dry out. There are a few dry-baked stretches that remind me of what some of that Moab-style slickrock looks like, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t as much fun to ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>spring again</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/240425-spring-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 13:26:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/240425-spring-again/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is almost the end of April in 2024 and my Strava account says I&amp;rsquo;m in better shape than I was at any point last year.

&lt;p>In the first week there was a fast group and a slow group, which I definitely knew I should stick with (Strava number notwithstanding). My suspicions were justified the next week when chatting with one of the riders who&amp;rsquo;d been in the first week fast group. Apparently their average speed wasn&amp;rsquo;t that crazy, but they&amp;rsquo;re so strong in the wind. Some of them used to be Cat 1&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> racers so yeah, best shape of my life is still going to leave me in a puddle by the side of the road keeping up with them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>velocity cycling club</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/vcc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/vcc/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://velocitycyclingclub.ca">Velocity Cycling Club&lt;/a> is the group I ride with.

&lt;p>Apparently on the Saturday race (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend) there were some big crashes by people trying to bunny-hop the obstacles and failing badly. One of them happened when the rider came unclipped between barriers, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think there were too huge of injuries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>school of cross 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schoolofcross2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/schoolofcross2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;p>We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did. I went the fastest I&amp;rsquo;d ever done 40km.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>zombie baby walter cross 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was the last competitor across the line in the Novice class of the Zombie Baby Walter Cross race. But a bunch of people had been lapped or did not finish, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually in last place. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how that feels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not so funny how it feels to wipe out trying to turn while sliding down a grassy hill. Which I did. But I kept going, gritting my teeth while kids in my race were bunny-hopping the barriers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>tubs on tubs superduper prestige 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/tubsontubs2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/tubsontubs2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>I returned to &lt;a href="../cx/">cyclocross&lt;/a> in 2022, and went back to the same race in the same park. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that makes this a classic or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d tested this course beforehand. My house is just across the river from the &amp;ldquo;indestructible &lt;a href="../strathconasciencepark/">Strathcona Science Park&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> so this was where I&amp;rsquo;d been riding up and down hills and practicing my off-cambers the week before.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s rutted and full of gopher holes and apparently has toxic seepage in places. There&amp;rsquo;s no sandy area but it does have a big downhill with long stairs for a runup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my &amp;ldquo;home course&amp;rdquo; because I used to live just across the river, so it&amp;rsquo;s a convenient place to practice my &lt;a href="../cx/">cx&lt;/a> race techniques, do laps to build my stamina and just generally rip around.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>stieda classic 2022</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/stiedaclassic2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>My knee went pop in the last 7km of the ride and Mike who I&amp;rsquo;d been riding with left me behind. It was all right though. I was going to finish my first road race. And yes, I was slow, but that was okay.&lt;/p>

It isn&amp;rsquo;t always so externalized but even on the days when the sky is clear this is a foul place to be exiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reading &lt;em>The Silmarillion&lt;/em> these days and I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how much I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s elves. I&amp;rsquo;m hurt by and see my own follies in Feanor&amp;rsquo;s foolish oaths that lead to exile and ruin. That it&amp;rsquo;s told in high-spoken language makes it feel more significant than my bullshit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>heading east for sunsets and seasons</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/161028-eastward/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2016 02:20:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/161028-eastward/</guid><description>&lt;p>In followup to the last post, yes, I did enjoy Nanaimo more than Campbell River. But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to be moving again. My partner and I are headed to Edmonton to start new jobs on November 7th. It&amp;rsquo;s a return to the prairies for me and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll like it better than I did when last I lived in Winnipeg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my 30s out on the west coast and I do like the mildness of the winters here. But maybe it&amp;rsquo;s okay to live somewhere a little harder to deal with. A little (lot) colder, but with better food (non-sushi division). The new job should be much better than working for my former employer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
