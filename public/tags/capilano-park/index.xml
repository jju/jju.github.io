      <description>Tech Guide Location: Capilano Park Edmonton Course: stravalink Part two of the first Edmonton race weekend saw way more people (in my race at least). The course went backwards compared to Jim Horner the previous day. This was good for me because it meant we had a non-technical climb right after the start, and that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m pretty decent at. It also meant that the switchbacks we&amp;rsquo;d been climbing on Saturday were now a descent.</description>

      <description>Tech Guide Location: Capilano Park Edmonton Course: stravalink 1&#xA;The Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well. Unlike last year we had clear skies with no Air Quality warnings so all the races happened.&#xA;Being in Novice Men, I had an early start while the grass was still dewy and wet. The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it).</description>

      <description>Tech Guide Location: Capilano Park Edmonton Course: stravalink I was so happy this race wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking place in Argyll Park this year. I hated the downhill that someone broke a collarbone on last year and lost so much time on it. Capilano Park was near my house and I could practice on it. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t practice hard enough on wet enough grass, because hoo boy did I not do well on that terrain.</description>

      <description>Capilano Park is a park in the city of Edmonton, where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually expect a cx race to work, but it does.&#xA;As far as the singletrack in the park goes, this is where you connect up with Goldbar Park and the cool trails in there. I generally prefer riding Eastbound.&#xA;races Jim Horner Grand Prix 2023 School of Cross 2023 Midweek CX Series 2023 </description>

      <description>As part of my season preparations I decided to at least try the midweek cx racing that goes on in Edmonton. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird because it&amp;rsquo;s so casual and hard to find information about. There are people asking questions in the Alberta CX Facebook group and you get a response with a screenshot from somewhere(?) giving a schedule. It seems that the people who know, know.&#xA;And holy crap did a lot of people know about it last night!</description>
