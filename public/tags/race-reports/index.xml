&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>The first time I &lt;a href="../puncheurcross2022">raced CX in Devon&lt;/a>, I loved it. &lt;a href="../hopnhurl2023/">Last year&lt;/a> I was injured beforehand so it turned out to be my worst race of the season, but it was still such a good course it was hard to really be down on it. This year I wasn&amp;rsquo;t hurt and just came in to have a good time.

&lt;p>Part of what makes Devon a fun course is the variety of terrain. Races at &lt;a href="../capilanopark/">Capilano&lt;/a> are grass grass grass (with a few roots on the 50m of singletrack), but at Voyageur Park you&amp;rsquo;ve got grass and dirt and pavement and a beach and sand, all in the leaves changing colour, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice. Different terrain also forces the racers into different choices. I was watching the Sport Men mostly from the sand pit while kibitzing with a few more experienced racers. There was a choice to make there over whether to try riding the sand or to pick up your bike and run. When I was watching most people were running it. I tried to ride it on my preride, but with the hairpin coming in, it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it. If you could stay on, you&amp;rsquo;d have a better chance of also riding up the short uphill right after the pit, but more people I saw put their bikes down then rode up after smoother remounts than I&amp;rsquo;m capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>jim horner grand prix 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;p>The Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well. Unlike last year we had clear skies with no Air Quality warnings so all the races happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being in Novice Men, I had an early start while the grass was still dewy and wet. The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it). I did that switchback okay in practice, but on the opening lap I totally wiped out, delaying a bunch of people behind me. Once that was out of the way though, I had a good race. I was following some people and eventually passed them. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get in touch with the leaders of the race but I had a pretty good run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the range gravel race 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/range2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/range2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>Back when I was thinking about the bike riding I wanted to do this year, a gravel event was on my mind. The idea with a gravel race is it&amp;rsquo;s a long route on dirt roads away from traffic. There&amp;rsquo;s a mass start and though there are fast people &amp;ldquo;racing&amp;rdquo; the event there will be far more just out there doing the ride, trying to finish and have a good time&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>pigeon lake road race 2024</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/pigeonlake2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/pigeonlake2024/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned on racing Pigeon Lake this year. I&amp;rsquo;d been waiting on my race fee reimbursement before entering the &lt;a href="../stiedaclassic2023/">Stieda&lt;/a> &lt;a href="../stiedaclassic2022/">Classic&lt;/a> again, but that came kind of late. A couple of people from my club mentioned that since I&amp;rsquo;m a bit better climber than a big powerful guy, I might find Pigeon Lake more suitable. I debated a bunch, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I tried it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>baby walter cross 2023 - day 2</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2023-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/zombiebabywaltercross2023-2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>I had hoped to do more racing this year, but it turned out that four was what I could handle with my work and other life commitments. So the second day of Baby Walter Cross was my season closer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The course this year went the opposite direction of &lt;a href="../zombiebabywaltercross2022/">2022&lt;/a> which I think I preferred. The climbing of the stupid hill was still tough, but the descents weren&amp;rsquo;t terrifying and we got to skip the runup in favour of a singletrack descent (with roots that were highlighted but you needed to dodge).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hardcore hop n hurl 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/hopnhurl2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

Unfortunately I had &lt;a href="../231017-scars/">a training crash&lt;/a> the Tuesday before this race, which put me in kind of a bad place. Mostly scraped up, but also a bit of a bruised wrist and some bruised ribs. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d be okay to race still, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting my expectations too high.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>jim horner grand prix 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/jimhornergrandprix2023/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class='book-hint '>

And it did for the Novice Men, Sport Men and Sport Women categories, but sadly, the AQHI hit 11 and the afternoon races had to be cancelled (along with the next day&amp;rsquo;s entire &lt;a href="../velocitycross2023/">Velocity CX Race&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I got my race in, and it was really fun! I was fighting for a good position at the beginning and because I was pushing too hard on the off-camber turns, I wiped out a bit in the long grass. Then coming out of the big downhill I cut the corner a little too close and got caught up in the course tape, which cost me time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>velocity criterium 2023</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/velocitycrit2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/velocitycrit2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our &lt;a href="../vcc/">club&lt;/a> put on a criterium and in my effort to try out a few different kinds of racing (despite being a slowpoke) I entered.

This time there were three riders instead of two at the &lt;a href="../stiedaclassic2023/">Stieda&lt;/a> race earlier.

He was confused and could probably have been in the Mens&amp;rsquo; Category 4. But there we were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did.
