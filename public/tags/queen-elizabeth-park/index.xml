      <description>Tech Guide Location: Queen Elizabeth Park Edmonton Course: stravalink I had hoped to do more racing this year, but it turned out that four was what I could handle with my work and other life commitments. So the second day of Baby Walter Cross was my season closer.&#xA;1&#xA;The course this year went the opposite direction of 2022 which I think I preferred. The climbing of the stupid hill was still tough, but the descents weren&amp;rsquo;t terrifying and we got to skip the runup in favour of a singletrack descent (with roots that were highlighted but you needed to dodge).</description>

      <description>Tech Guide Location: Queen Elizabeth Park Edmonton Course: stravalink Baby Walter Cross is a two-day race put on by the Alberta Cyclocross Collective, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a club exactly, just all the cx lovers in Edmonton. The park has a really big hill, which makes for a lot of climbing.&#xA;Apparently on the Saturday race (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend) there were some big crashes by people trying to bunny-hop the obstacles and failing badly.</description>

      <description>I was the last competitor across the line in the Novice class of the Zombie Baby Walter Cross race. But a bunch of people had been lapped or did not finish, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually in last place. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how that feels.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s not so funny how it feels to wipe out trying to turn while sliding down a grassy hill. Which I did. But I kept going, gritting my teeth while kids in my race were bunny-hopping the barriers.</description>
