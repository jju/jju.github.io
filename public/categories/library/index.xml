      <description>Around our workplace there&amp;rsquo;s a joke that we should all be putting &amp;ldquo;award-winning librarian&amp;rdquo; in our bios when we show up in the outside world. After all, who is to say that the participation award from your grade 4 track meet isn&amp;rsquo;t what made you the professional you are today?&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve totally done it though. I called myself award-winning in the bio for a talk Jason and I gave at the Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference a few weeks ago, because I really did win an award for making radio back in journalism school.</description>

      <description>This is a slightly modified version of the text (and slides) from my talk at Oh, the Places You&amp;rsquo;ll Know, a part of SFU&amp;rsquo;s Public Square on September 19, 2012. We were encouraged to put practical considerations aside, hence the &amp;ldquo;damn the lawyers; full speed ahead!&amp;rdquo; approach advocated within.&#xA;My big idea for public libraries is that they should embrace the role of &amp;ldquo;Your Friendly Neighbourhood Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy.</description>
