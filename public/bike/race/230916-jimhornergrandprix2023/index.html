<p>I was so happy this race wasn&rsquo;t taking place in <a href="places/argyllpark.md">Argyll Park</a> this year. I hated the downhill that someone broke a collarbone on last year and lost so much time on it. <a href="places/capilanopark.md">Capilano Park</a> was near my house and I could practice on it. But I didn&rsquo;t practice hard enough on wet enough grass, because hoo boy did I not do well on that terrain.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/jhgp23_mob.jpg" alt="first lap once I was back on my bike"></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like much there, but that grass was really dewy and for me that was tricky doing the turning back up a hill after going down it. Right after the start line there was a steep uphill, then three of these down and ups. Oof. I wiped out in the first uphill and then had trouble clipping back in and by then I was way back from following my benchmark rival.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/jhgp23_shoulder_4x3p.jpg" alt="muddy runup"></p>
<p>As the laps went on and we spread out it was better. I liked the course apart from those slippy down and ups. I shouldered my bike for the runups and even managed to navigate a bad hairpin fairly successfully 3/5 of the laps. That didn&rsquo;t stop me from being exhausted coming up the slippy hill trying to maintain traction. My kid was there cheering for me and I had enough breath to tell him it was my &ldquo;I want to go home&rdquo; lap.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/jhgp23_climb_4x3p.jpg" alt="wanna go home climb"></p>
<p>By the last lap I&rsquo;d passed a few people and was well-ensconced in my 12th place between a couple of ERTC riders. One of them lost time by mishandling the barriers which gave me a bit of a cushion. In the end, despite it sucking, I was sorry I had to work the next day so I&rsquo;d miss <a href="230917-schoolofcross2023.md">School of Cross</a>, running on the same course.</p>
<p>Later in the day the smoke took over, so the Open Women category had a shortened race, and the Open Men didn&rsquo;t take to the field, which makes for a disappointing season.</p>
