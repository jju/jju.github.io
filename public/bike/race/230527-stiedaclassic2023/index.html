    <p>We only had two people in my category for this race. The category being Citizen, which is supposed to be a mixed gender, less intense beginner kind of racing. The other guy, Keith, was also part of [[2305171104-vcc|my cycling club]] but he said he was only in this class by mistake. He was confused and could probably have been in the Mens&rsquo; Category 4. But there we were.</p>
<p>We got to start with the Women Cat 4 group which was awesome. They pushed me hard and did all the work so I just had to hang with the bunch. And I did. I went the fastest I&rsquo;d ever done 40km.</p>
<p>And then boom, &ldquo;Yipe!&rdquo;, there was a crash in front of me, one of the women went down on the straightaway after the first lap, another rider hit her and apparently went over her handlebars. I slowed down. Do I help? But that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a race, it&rsquo;s organized there are paramedics. The indecision before trying to catch back up with the group meant I never could hitch back on.</p>
<p>I followed a rider who was a long way ahead of me for the first half? third? of the next lap. He was wearing a jersey like mine, and I was pretty sure he must have been dropped off the back of the Cat 4 Men. It was good to see him up there, motivating, and eventually I caught up. He was another [[2305171104-vcc|VCC]] member, Sheldon, and we chatted. He&rsquo;s 23 and he&rsquo;ll be able to train his way up into hanging with those Cat 4 racers. Me? I think I&rsquo;ll stick with the slowpokes if they keep offering the category.</p>
<p>On the final couple of kilometres Sheldon left me behind and I just rode my own ride to the end. Keith and Coach Kevin were waiting for me. I actually felt pretty good. I think I need to work on my fuelling strategy, because I did feel a bit weak nearer the end. But my knee didn&rsquo;t go pop and I went over 5km/h faster than I did last year, so I think it was a success.</p>
