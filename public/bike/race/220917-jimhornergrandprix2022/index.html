    <p>My second race of the <a href="2211121613-cyclocross-season.md">2022 cyclocross season</a> was presented by the Juventus Cycling Club at  the Argyll Velodrome. Not in the velodrome itself, but the park surrounding it. When I was looking at the map in the preceding days I wasn&rsquo;t sure where the ups and downs and how it would work as a course. There was a toboggan hill. Were we going to have to up that? Down it?</p>
<p>On the morning of the race I got there early enough for my preride to get a sense of things, but it was still very confusing what was going on between the tape, especially in a bunch of the back and forths.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was better in the race itself.</p>
<p>The course had one set of stairs and a really steep climb in the dirt that on the first lap I couldn&rsquo;t ride but later managed. What torpedoed my race was a really steep dirt descent in mud and roots that felt really dangerous. Because of that lack of confidence, even though I rode it once at race pace I ended up following the 11-year-old kid<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> who was running down it all race. I probably could have pulled away if I had ridden but I didn&rsquo;t feel confident enough descending clipped in.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the race I was hovering around 9th or 10th, having gotten stuck way behind the main group of riders due to my terrible descending. By the third lap I was so tired I clipped my pedal on the ground and wiped out on an off-camber bit<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> just after the pit. I managed to pull through and followed the kid I&rsquo;d been riding with all race across the line. Some of the guys I&rsquo;d seen at <a href="220902-tubsontubs2022.md">Tubs on Tubs</a> were at the finish and I made some comment about hoping there was a prize for being beaten by an 11-year-old.</p>
<p>In the end this turned out to be my best placing of the 2022 season<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, but it wasn&rsquo;t my favourite race. That would come <a href="221002-puncheurcross2022.md">a couple of weeks later</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that some pedestrians on the walking trails had removed a bunch of the tape between the previous night&rsquo;s setup and the preride.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>On lap 2 or so, I saw the kid&rsquo;s mom taking pictures and I gasped out that he was really good.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>At the time I thought this descent was crazy. Now, having watched real cyclocross at speed I realize how tame it was, and how much I need to work on my skills.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>When I later got the ABA results loaded into <a href="https://crossresults.com">crossresults</a> my score for this - my only top-10 finish in a race - was my worst of my CX career thus far.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
