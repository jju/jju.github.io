    <p>I loved the Devon Puncheur race. I also love that it got a writeup entitled <a href="https://www.swagman.ca/blogs/news/the-best-grassroots-cyclocross-race-you-ve-never-heard-of">The Best Grassroots Cyclocross Race You&rsquo;ve Never Heard of</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I hadn&rsquo;t been to Devon, which is just southwest of Edmonton, before this race, but Voyageur Park was a really nice example of this region&rsquo;s river valley terrain. The course went through the trees, around a flat corkscrew feature, down by the river and was my introduction to sand on a &lsquo;cross course.</p>

<p>Sand is a pain to ride through! It also was trickier because just before the sand pit there was a sharp hairpin around a bench that I needed to shed a load of speed before. On my practice laps I couldn&rsquo;t make it through the sand and had to run. In the race itself I think I rode the sand twice, ran it once fairly cleanly and wiped out once (which led to a lot of swearing and a heap of apologies to the commissaires and riders around me for the cussing).</p>
<p>But the sand was something to anticipate, not exactly a dreading kind of thing. For myself I enjoy the punchy little climbs in a course where I can gap a person behind me. Puncheur had a couple of those, including one that was too steep for me to ride.</p>

<p>By the end I&rsquo;d done my best race <a href="2211121613-cyclocross-season.md">of the season</a>, and the food was delicious.</p>
