<p>It&rsquo;s not a clean replacement, of course. I use the internet to think about bikes and get ideas for future bikes and shop for bike parts. The manufacture of these bikes is part of the whole overseas manufacturing supply chain that relies on standardized shipping containers and that same communication and fossil fuel burning network that I am trying to escape.</p>
<p>But I <em>can</em> escape with a bike. I can ride and it feels like flying even if I&rsquo;m actually not very fast.</p>
