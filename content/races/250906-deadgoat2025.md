My first race in Sport Men had 30 people signed up (and I got call-up number 25). Ahead of the race I waffled on driving down the night before but decided to just do a big driving day on Saturday instead of sleeping in my car. It worked out fine!

The seminary in Cochrane where we race is super bumpy but not very technical. There are some ups and downs and barriers, but no run-ups, no sand. The biggest challenge is a long draggy climb. I started off the race at the very back of the pack, but made some passes coming up that long climb in the first lap. Later on I passed a couple more riders when they dropped chains or had other mechanicals.[^2] 

[^2]: One of them caught back up and passed me again.

All in all, I had a good race. My lap times were all within 9 seconds of each other so I spent my 40 minutes at threshold heart rate without exploding. I also didn't break a wheel in any of the many gopher holes.
