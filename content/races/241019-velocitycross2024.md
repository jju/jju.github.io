This was the race put on by [our club](../../posts/vcc/) so I went out to do at least a bit of help with the setup on the Friday night. Because [last year](../velocitycross2023/) our race got smoked out, people got half price entry for this year. And socks!

My race was forgettable because on the very first lap there was an off-camber bit and my tire went flat[^1]. I hadn't brought anything to the pit to keep myself going, so I put it up on my shoulder and ran for a couple of kilometres until I got back to the finish line and withdrew from the race.
