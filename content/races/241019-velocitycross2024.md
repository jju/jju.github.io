Last year [Sidney McGill](https://cyclocross24.com/rider/sidney-mcgill-/) was going to be racing in the Open Men category and I was really excited to see her, and to race in the Novice Men, but by 7am the AQHI was over 10 and no one wanted to get blacklung for a race (also the Alberta Bicycle Association won't let you do anything if the index is over 7). It sucked, but there wasn't anything else to do about it.
