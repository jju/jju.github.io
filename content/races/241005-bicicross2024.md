At one point in my season planning, I was going to be attending this race, but then things changed and I ended up working an evening shift the night before, which meant I'd need to get up at 4am to get to Calgary the next day, which wasn't happening. It looked like a beautiful day for 'cross racing from the Facebook pictures I've seen.
