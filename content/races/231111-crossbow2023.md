I missed out on writing this up at the end of the 2023 [CX](../cx/) season, and now that 2024 has come around, I don't have a bunch of the data I like to put in these race writeups. Nonetheless, here's what I can find (thankfully I did do my CrossResults upload back when the race happened).

This race was postponed from earlier in the month because of some freakish weather. There was supposed to be a second race on the Sunday but with the rescheduling, that didn't happen.
