Provincials!
![The runup that a few people could ride.](/tubs24_rideup.jpg)[^1]

[^1]: Ryan Maclean riding up the runup in the Open/Junior Men's race. He ended up coming in 2nd place.

Another race in [Argyll Park](../argyllpark/) and this was a fun one. The runup pictured above was super steep and I was so happy we were going up it. A few years ago this was a downhill section and one person broke a collarbone. I ran down it that year because I am not a confident descender at the best of times.

This was also my first year competing in a provincial championship in my age category. They did very deep call-ups and people gave me a nice little bit of applause for doing the stat-keeping of getting our ABA Cup races into [CrossResults](https://www.crossresults.com). I had swapped out wheels from the previous day but something ended up being very wrong with my brakes, so I had hugely slow lap times due to an abundance of caution. I was undoubtedly the slowest, but didn't come in last place because another rider DNFed[^3]. 

[^3]: Did Not Finish. Like me at [the previous day's race](../velocitycross2024/).
