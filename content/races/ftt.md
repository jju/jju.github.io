Fat Tire Tuesday is a cross-country mountain bike race series in Edmonton. In 2024, all the races are happening at [Terwillegar park](../terwillegarpark). The races cost $5 and you can enter in three categories (the fastest do 4 laps, the slower people do 3 laps and the slowest only do 2). There's a point structure and a [group on Strava](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1042773) where the news of race results/cancellations happen.

Further reading of my personal responses with the races can be found under the [ftt tag](../../tags/ftt/) or in my season summaries below:
