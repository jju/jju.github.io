I had hoped to do more racing this year, but it turned out that four was what I could handle with my work and other life commitments. So the second day (first day info here: [231014-babywaltercross2023](231014-babywaltercross2023.md)) of Baby Walter Cross was my season closer.

The course this year went the opposite direction of [2022](221015-zombiebabywaltercross2022.md) which I think I preferred. The climbing of the stupid hill was still tough, but the descents weren't terrifying and we got to skip the runup in favour of a singletrack descent (with roots that were highlighted but you needed to dodge).

I was never really in the mix on this one, pretty sure I was defending 24th after taking my descents too cautiously. I did manage to avoid being lapped (by like 10 seconds) so I could do my final lap in peace and enjoyment. Of course that was when I tossed my chain into my spokes on the long grindy climb and had to spend a couple of minutes getting it out.

But even then I was having fun. Riding between the tape has been the happiest I've been this year
