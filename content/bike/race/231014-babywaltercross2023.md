Baby Walter Cross is a two-day race put on by the Alberta Cyclocross Collective, which isn't a club exactly, just all the [cx](cx.md) lovers in Edmonton. The park has a really big hill, which makes for a lot of climbing.

Apparently on the Saturday race (which I didn't attend) there were some big crashes by people trying to bunny-hop the obstacles and failing badly. One of them happened when the rider came unclipped between barriers, but I don't think there were too huge of injuries.
