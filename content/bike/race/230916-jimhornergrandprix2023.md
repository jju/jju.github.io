I was so happy this race wasn't taking place in [Argyll Park](places/argyllpark.md) this year. I hated the downhill that someone broke a collarbone on last year and lost so much time on it. [Capilano Park](places/capilanopark.md) was near my house and I could practice on it. But I didn't practice hard enough on wet enough grass, because hoo boy did I not do well on that terrain.

It doesn't look like much there, but that grass was really dewy and for me that was tricky doing the turning back up a hill after going down it. Right after the start line there was a steep uphill, then three of these down and ups. Oof. I wiped out in the first uphill and then had trouble clipping back in and by then I was way back from following my benchmark rival.

As the laps went on and we spread out it was better. I liked the course apart from those slippy down and ups. I shouldered my bike for the runups and even managed to navigate a bad hairpin fairly successfully 3/5 of the laps. That didn't stop me from being exhausted coming up the slippy hill trying to maintain traction. My kid was there cheering for me and I had enough breath to tell him it was my "I want to go home" lap.

By the last lap I'd passed a few people and was well-ensconced in my 12th place between a couple of ERTC riders. One of them lost time by mishandling the barriers which gave me a bit of a cushion. In the end, despite it sucking, I was sorry I had to work the next day so I'd miss [School of Cross](230917-schoolofcross2023.md), running on the same course.

Later in the day the smoke took over, so the Open Women category had a shortened race, and the Open Men didn't take to the field, which makes for a disappointing season.
