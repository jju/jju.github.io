Welcome to the revised and resurrected dubious monk website. 

I'm J Jack Unrau and this is where I'm collecting some of my writing.

The bloggish stuff is organized as [posts](/posts/). If you aren't interested in sorting through everything, I'd check out the [list of categories](/categories/) or more fine-grained topics through the [tags page](/tags/).

I'm also on [Mastodon](https://glammr.us/@dbsmnk) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/)
