In followup to the last post, yes, I did enjoy Nanaimo more than Campbell River. But now it's time to be moving again. My partner and I are headed to Edmonton to start new jobs on November 7th. It's a return to the prairies for me and I think I'll like it better than I did when last I lived in Winnipeg.

I've spent most of my 30s out on the west coast and I do like the mildness of the winters here. But maybe it's okay to live somewhere a little harder to deal with. A little (lot) colder, but with better food (non-sushi division). The new job should be much better than working for my former employer.

Maybe I'll write more. I hope to, but am not promising anything.
