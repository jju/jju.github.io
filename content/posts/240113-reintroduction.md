## hello again

I'm J Jack Unrau. I used to write on the internet some. I haven't for several years. But the muscles should still work. I think.

The plan here is to fill in some gaps. I don't believe I'll be getting as library-ish as [the old librarianaut blog](https://librarianaut.wordpress.com/) ever was. There'll be more about [bikes](../../tags/cycling/) than there ever used to be. I don't think I'll be writing too much about my kid, but we'll see.
