[Velocity Cycling Club](https://velocitycyclingclub.ca) is the group I ride with. There are a few clubs in the Edmonton area that I could have joined. I was going to join [ERTC (Edmonton Road and Track Club)](https://ertc.org/) back in 2020 but doing things in groups wasn't feasible that year. I ended up with VCC mostly because a couple of the older guys from their club were friendly at a few of my [2022 cyclocross races](cxseason2022.md). Also, nice jerseys without extraneous advertising.
