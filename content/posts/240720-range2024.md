Back when I was thinking about the bike riding I wanted to do this year, a gravel event was on my mind. The idea with a gravel race is it's a long route on dirt roads away from traffic. There's a mass start and though there are fast people "racing" the event there will be far more just out there doing the ride, trying to finish and have a good time[^1].

There are a few organized events in Alberta, spanning the calendar from June to October[^2]. I settled on [The Range](https://thegravelexperience.com/pages/routes_the_range) mostly because they have an arrangement with a couple of ranches in southern Alberta where you get access to their roads which would normally be closed. Being able to ride somewhere I couldn't just go and ride by myself was a big draw.

[^2]: In 2024 [Ghost of the Gravel](https://deadgoat.ca/ghostofthegravel/) in June was the Canadian National Gravel Championship, [Velocity Afterburner](https://velocitycyclingclub.ca/event/2024-velocity-afterburner-gravel/) in September is the Alberta Provincial Gravel Championship, then there's The Range in July, [Festivus of Gravel](http://www.stiedacycling.com/festivusofgravel) in August, and the Croken Classic in October.

I drove down to Claresholm on Friday night to pick up my race number and check into a motel. No camping because I wanted a better sleep than I could get in a hot tent[^3]. The town of Claresholm was small and right next to canola fields and foothills a bit further away. I spent my evening preparing my bike and reminding myself not to go too hard too early in the race. I definitely felt some impostery feelings. I was doing this not on a fancy gravel bike, just my old cyclocrosser Bullwinkle. My tires were probably too knobby. I was probably too weak to finish before the time cut. This was all a huge mistake.

Morning came and I felt better. I ate my overnight oats and headed for the start line.

The first part of the race I was very conscious of not overextending myself. I rode in bunches and didn't doo too much to try and catch people when they picked up the pace. Eventually though I started catching up with people on some climbs. After passing Albert (you can see him on the eye-catching pink bike (which I always try to compliment him on) in the picture above) I caught up with a couple of Terrascape racers who were going a nice easy pace. I hung with them for a long time until we were caught by some of the people I'd left behind climbing earlier. When they passed I felt nice and recovered so I rolled with them.

Once hitting the ranch, I'd gotten away from the group. I did the creek crossing and made it to the first aid station where I availed myself of a cold wet neck sponge thing someone's grandma had made for the riders. Then it was up The Wall.

![The Wall](/range2024-wallclimb.jpg "First time up the Wall")

I'd been warned about the Wall, but due to some inattention I didn't realize I'd be climbing it in both directions. In my head when I reached the top of this climb, the worst of the whole event was over. Ha! I don't know if it would have made that much of a difference in my approach to know differently -- maybe I wouldn't have emptied myself out so much on this climb -- but still.

After that climb it was a super-steep descent where I was pulling the brakes mightily. I made it to the bottom without incident and then realized how much climbing there was left to do. It was so much - not as steep as the wall, but long. I had to walk for a while because even in my spinniest gear I couldn't keep pedaling. Eventually I reached the peak and started down.

I'm not a confident descender so I was passed by a bunch of folks coming down. At one point I did have to stop and take a couple of pictures because holy crap it was a beautiful day and it felt great to be riding a bike out there. Then more descending (with some climbs where I was occasionally passing people who'd passed me going down). This was more gradual than the white-knuckle steepness coming down from the Wall, but I gradually realized I'd have to ride up that steepness, so anxiety was building. Thankfully when I rounded the corner to see the Wall again, everyone in sight was walking their bikes up, so I did too.

![Descending the Wall](/range2024-walldescent.jpg "This picture was taken about 30 seconds before I crashed")

That was it! Now I could freewheel down the hill carefully to the aid station. I was free and clear! Huzzah! Then I hit some loose gravel that was covering the good line and my front wheel went left out from under me and I hit the ground skidding. I didn't hit my head. As I picked myself and bike up to get out of the way of the riders descending, I assessed things. My chest was dirty. My hips felt scraped. I had some bloodiness on my knee and elbow. When I got my bike up my levers were twisted from the impact. I tested the brakes and they still worked even from their weird positions, so I could still ride it, which I did down to the aid station.

At the station they were amazing. There was a mechanic from Ridley's who got my levers back in appropriate-ish positions. There was a paramedic who cleaned out my knee and elbow wounds and wrapped up my elbow (and said "I think it's all soft tissue, but you might want an x-ray"). And there were hydrators giving me water, and new cold neckie things and making me feel really lucky I crashed where I did. The mechanic did the best he could but my handlebars were actually bent so I'd have "bad ergo" for the rest of the ride, though I should be okay to do the last 40km. It could have been so much worse.

For the last third of the race I eventually caught on with a few guys I'd passed and been passed by and rode with them to the end. I was hurting so I didn't take any pulls on the front, which I felt bad about near the end when one of them totally cracked and the others stuck with him out of solidarity. I rolled on alone for the last 3 km or so and finished my first gravel event in 86th place overall.

Afterwards I was chatting with a couple of [VCC](../vcc/) riders (who are older and faster than me) about how different that was than a group ride on the road. Just the extra energy you have to spend on the rougher surfaces and the shattering effects where you aren't just doing pulls for 1/8 the time or whatever. I think it was the amount of work that made me like it, made me feel like this was a worthy accomplishment to focus my summer on[^6]. 

Next year if I go back, I know how much of a climb I need to be ready for and I can train for that better. I can also probably not crash, which would have been nice.

[^3]: Earlier in the week the forecast had been for 36 Celsius and the organizers had shortened the route. By Friday the forecast was only 31C so we were back to 122km.
