It is August and 'Cross is Coming[^1]. I'm getting excited because cyclocross[^2] is for whatever reason my favourite kind of bike racing.

I say "for whatever reason" because it doesn't seem intuitive to me that this would be my favourite. I'm not a big powerful rider pushing massive watts. I fall over a lot riding around on rough terrain. I don't like being cold and wet.

But yet, when I did my first cyclocross race I enjoyed it. I came back [last year to do more](../cxseason2022/). And even though I'm in the slowest category racing against kids and old guys, I really like it. I feel exhausted at the end of a race but I want to do it again.

It probably helps that we've had warm autumns since I started trying this out, so I haven't been doing the bitter shivering or sliding down icy off-cambers.

In the offseason I started compiling the [Alberta Cyclo-cross Cup](https://www.albertabicycle.ab.ca/series-standings) race results into a spreadsheet to get a better sense of who the racers are. Like, in 2022 I had a nemesis in the races. How did he do in the races I didn't enter? Getting all the data in one place seemed useful. So I built a Google Sheet. And then I learned about [crossresults.com](https://crossreults.com) and revamped my results to get them into a place for the wider North American scene (which also does fancier things than my little csv could handle).

The other thing I'm trying to do this year is become a bit more social in the bike world. I'm in [a cycling club](../vcc/) now so I will have people wearing the same shirt as me at races. CX is supposed to be a social kind of experience[^3]. In Belgium they cheer and crowd in for races and drink loads of beer and make lots of noise. Edmonton (and [Devon](../../tags/devon/)) is the only place I've raced and Central Alberta's a lot more sedate. But there is a facebook group where people discuss things like local tire pressure and going to Nationals and the like.

In any case, I've signed up for my first race weekend of 2023 ([Tubs on Tubs Supercalifragiliciousxpialidocius Prestige](../tubsontubs2023/) & [Velocity CX](../velocitycross2023/)) and am getting antsy waiting for it all to begin.

[^1]: I wonder, did the "Cross is Coming" meme originate with Game of Thrones' HBO popularity? I assume so and am not checking.
[^2]: Usually I'll be typing "cyclocross" or "CX" but "cyclo-cross" is also a legitimate spelling out there. See more on my [cx](../cx/) page.
[^3]: The whole fact that it happens in a limited area makes it easier to watch laps of. My kid can come to a 'cross race and see me every 9 or 10 minutes as I come around a lap, rather than needing to just hang around and wait near a finish line for hours.
