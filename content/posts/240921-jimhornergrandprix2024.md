The Jim Horner Grand Prix of Cyclo-cross was my first Edmonton race of the season, and it went well. Unlike last year we had clear skies with no Air Quality warnings so all the races happened.

Being in Novice Men, I had an early start while the grass was still dewy and wet. The course opened with a bunch of twisty turns including an uphill off-camber thing (see the picture above of the Sport Men tackling it). I did that switchback okay in practice, but on the opening lap I totally wiped out, delaying a bunch of people behind me. Once that was out of the way though, I had a good race. I was following some people and eventually passed them. I couldn't quite get in touch with the leaders of the race but I had a pretty good run.

I then spent the rest of the day hanging out at the bike races, which was fun. I got [some decent pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hungry_j/albums/72177720320499987/) and chatted a bunch with different racers, which made me feel a little bit like a part of the 'cross community.
