[Sidney McGill](https://cyclocross24.com/rider/sidney-mcgill-/) was going to be racing in the Open Men category and I was really excited to see her, and to race in the Novice Men, but by 7am the AQHI was over 10 and no one wanted to get blacklung for a race (also the Alberta Bicycle Association won't let you do anything if the index is over 7). It sucked, but there wasn't anything else to do about it.

Next week the races are down in Cochrane and hopefully they have better luck. My next race will be the [Jim Horner Grand Prix](../jimhornergrandprix2023/).
