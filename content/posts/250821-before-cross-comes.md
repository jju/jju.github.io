The summer is almost done and I haven't updated this site in ages. But that is okay. I'm fine with not having written. Really and truly.

This year I haven't biked as much as I did last year. Part of that is because I've started volunteering once a week at [Bike Edmonton](https://bikeedmonton.ca/), which takes up time. Part of it is just being tired, and demoralized for being slow. I took up the mantle of Mountain Bike representative for [VCC](VCC.md) which meant I missed a few [ftt](ftt.md) races riding alone in [capilanopark](capilanopark.md) instead. When I did get in a couple of races, I was oh so slow, even though I worked so hard. I didn't make it out to the good mountain biking at all this summer. I didn't ride to work as much as I wanted. Just generally a blah kind of year.

But a couple of days ago, I grabbed the CX bike and rode around, up and down grassy hills, pushing hard for short bits of time. I burped a tire and decided I'll actually run tubes this year (with the benefit of being actually UCI-legal for tire width). Upon checking in with myself, I was pretty happy. We'll see how it goes between the tape.
