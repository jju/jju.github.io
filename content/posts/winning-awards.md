Around our workplace there's a joke that we should all be putting "award-winning librarian" in our bios when we show up in the outside world. After all, who is to say that the participation award from your grade 4 track meet isn't what made you the professional you are today? 

I've totally done it though. I called myself award-winning in the bio for a talk Jason and I gave at the Vancouver Island Library Staff Conference a few weeks ago, because I really did win an award for making radio back in journalism school. It seemed relevant as part of my radio librarian bona fides. But whatever. 

I worry about winning awards in librarianship. The things I tend to do are, while not designed to be high profile, a bit different from the standard librarian things. Which isn't to say I don't love the nuts & bolts kind of work of figuring out the answer to a tricky question - that's the reason I librarian at all - but I've always always always wanted to do something different from what other people are doing rather than do what they're doing better. So I see people who are amazeballs at storytime, bringing in huge crowds and getting all that awesome early learning stuff in there and I want to leave that to them and go do something else, like [our radio show](https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28Librarians+on+the+Radio%29+OR+title%3A%28Librarians+off+the+Radio%29+OR+title%3A%28Librarianautica%29&sort=-date "my librarianly radio output on the internet archive"), or e-privacy workshop type stuff. 

Which is fine and all. I get to do things I'm good at and let the people who are really good at the core libraryish things do them. But then I get twitchy about this because I'm basically just taking advantage of the novelty of what I'm doing to get recognition or whatever. It feels like an ego-stroke, a lot like going to the BC library conference is the only place in this world where I "know people" which can be weirdly ego-inflating. And then the people who are doing the really great normal librarian stuff get left out of the recognition party, which sucks. 

I don't want my flashy, kind-of-tangential-to-traditional-library-work projects to outshine my colleagues who are awesome in lower profile ways. Anyway yeah. Which is to say, I'm sorry for self-promoting. 

I think what we're doing with Librarians on the Radio is fun and a good use of my talents such as they are. We won a BCLA Merit award for it (well, our library did). It goes on the CV and we'll try to keep on making shows I hope are deserving of the recognition all my colleagues should be getting.
