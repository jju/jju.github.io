'Cross has come!
## Wednesday Night Worlds

Much like the [Fat Tire Tuesday](../ftt/) races, Edmonton has a series of $5 cx races in 'cross season. The A group starts a minute before the B group which starts a minute before the C group and everyone races for about 25 minutes.

* **Race 1** 2024-09-04: [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37727939) There were so many people at [Capilano Park](../capilanopark/) it was great. As I've discovered is usual there, I hated the down a steep hill then u-turn to climb it again manoeuvre. On one of my laps (I did 5) I got tangled in the tape (my downhill cornering could use some work) and had to run up the hill, but I made it through the rest of the times cleanly. I felt like I was in decent shape but man, I work a lot harder than when I do practice laps out there.
* **Race 2** 2024-09-11: I had to work.

According to [crossresults](https://crossresults.com) in 2022 I had a rating of 563.86[^3] and in 2023 my rating was 557.78. So by the numbers I was marginally more successful this year. My best race was better than my best in 2022 ([Tubs on Tubs 2023](../tubsontubs2023/) vs [Puncheur Cross 2022](../puncheurcross2022/)) and my worst race in 2023 was also better than my worst in 2022[^4].

My racing aside, the work I did with the ABA CX Cup stats and getting them uploaded into CrossResults was quite rewarding. Our good riders got better call-ups[^5] at the Pan-American Championships because their ABA results were somewhere the race organizers could use.

I think 2024 won't see me expanding my racing too much. I will probably still do a few through the summer, maybe a gravel event, and then try for more 'cross in the fall, especially the midweek stuff.

[^1]: My hardtail [Graymare](../graymare/) isn't great, but upgrading it would be really expensive for the amount and style of actual mountain biking I do.
[^2]: The races were [Tubs on Tubs](../tubsontubs2023), [Jim Horner](../jimhornergrandprix2023), [Hardcore Hop N Hurl](../hopnhurl2023) and the second day of [Baby Walter Cross](../babywaltercross-2).
[^3]: In their system lower is better. The best in the world have a rating under 100.
[^4]: Both of my bad races involved steep sketchy downhills I wasn't confident in riding at all. Looks like this is what I'll be working on for 2024.
[^5]: In cyclocross you get to start closer to the front of the race if you have more points/a better ranking. This makes a difference so you don't get stuck behind crashes or slowpokes right off the hop.
