The cyclocross season starts in September for us in Edmonton. Some years we've (apparently) had snow right for the first races. There are kind of three aspects to the season for me. A bunch of training, the casual races and the sanctioned Alberta Cup races. 

Training is training. I ride up and down hills and in parks.
## Wednesday Night Worlds

Much like the [Fat Tire Tuesday](../ftt/) races, Edmonton has a series of $5 cx races in 'cross season. The A group starts a minute before the B group which starts a minute before the C group and everyone races for about 25 minutes.

* **Race 1** 2024-09-04: [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37727939) There were so many people at [Capilano Park](../capilanopark/) it was great. As I've discovered is usual there, I hated the "down a steep hill then u-turn to climb it again" manoeuvre. On one of my laps (I did 5) I got tangled in the tape (my downhill cornering could use some work) and had to run up the hill, but I made it through the rest of the times cleanly. I felt like I was in decent shape but man, I work a lot harder than when I do practice laps out there.
* **Race 2** 2024-09-11: I had to work. Boooooo.
