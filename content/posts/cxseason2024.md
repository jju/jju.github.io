Then we came into ['cross season](../230824-cross-anticipation/). I raced four races[^2] which was less than I was hoping. Wildfires cancelled a couple and I had work and an injury and other issues I needed to deal with. It never really came together the way I would have liked. I did try out the [midweek cx racing](../wnw2023/) which was fun, and where I met [Sidney McGill](https://cyclocross24.com/rider/sidney-mcgill-/), World Cup 'Crosser.

## Wednesday Night Non-Sanctioned racing

For me, mountain bike racing is not something I'm super into, so I wouldn't pay much to do it like I do [cyclocross](../cx/), but the [Fat Tire Tuesday](../ftt/) races had always looked like fun so in 2024 I took the plunge.

* **Race 1** 2024-05-14: [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37005832) Started off with steep uphill on rocky surface. I got caught behind a couple of riders who went way slower than I could have, putting me in a hole the rest of the race. I was chasing a Hardcore Bike Club rider for most of the rest of the race. I gained time on the ups; he gained time everywhere else. There was one descent that was steep, kind of muddy and had a turn into a bridge right at the bottom. I had a tough time with it on my practice lap and managed to wipe out on it in Lap 2 (I'm a B-Group rider so I only did 3 laps). 
	* 5/6 for 6 points
* **Race 2** 2024-05-28[^1] : [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37005757) There was a prologue to stretch the group out a little before hitting the singletrack this week. Loads of climbing on this course. I was following one rider for most of the first lap before a pedal strike knocked me to a halt and my lost momentum meant I didn't see her again until the last third of the third lap. The rooty climb was tough, and I messed up the line on lap 2. In the end I was lapped by a **lot** of the fast group riders (by two of them in lap 2). 
	* 9/10 for 2 points
* **Race 3** 2024-06-18[^2] : [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37144430) The organizers made this a shorter loop because the Oilers were playing a must-win game in the Stanley Cup Final, so they wanted us to get out of there quickly. I was chasing another B-group rider on the second lap who, when she passed me said "Don't worry; I'm slow on the downhills." So as she was opening more of a gap going down I tried to go faster and then a moment of inattention meant I clipped my bars on a tree and crashed. It hurt. I finished the race, but never did catch up with her.
	* 4/6 for 7 points
* **Race 4** 2024-06-25: [stravalink](https://www.strava.com/segments/37193026) This was pretty much the same course as the first FTT race of the year (although for some reason, the segment says it's longer). I wiped out on that same off-camber descent I had trouble with in May, but managed to hang onto 2nd place in the B-Group nonetheless. Climbing is definitely where I gain a bit of time in these races.
	* 2/4 for 9 points
* **Race 5** 2024-07-02: Missed the race because of my kid's soccer game. They had a Le Mans style start[^3] though, which sounded fun.
* **Race 6** 2024-07-09: Missed the race because I was in Valemount doing a little mountain biking. This was a team trivia race, and I have no idea how that works.

[^1]: There was no race on May 21 because the radar showed rain, but it never came. I got a ride in that night anyway, since I hadn't been able to check Strava in time.
[^2]: There were no races on June 4 or June 11 due to rain.
[^3]: The bikes are all lying on the ground and the riders are standing away from them. When the whistle goes everyone runs to jump on their bikes and start riding.

According to [crossresults](https://crossresults.com) in 2022 I had a rating of 563.86[^3] and in 2023 my rating was 557.78. So by the numbers I was marginally more successful this year. My best race was better than my best in 2022 ([Tubs on Tubs 2023](../tubsontubs2023/) vs [Puncheur Cross 2022](../puncheurcross2022/)) and my worst race in 2023 was also better than my worst in 2022[^4].

My racing aside, the work I did with the ABA CX Cup stats and getting them uploaded into CrossResults was quite rewarding. Our good riders got better call-ups[^5] at the Pan-American Championships because their ABA results were somewhere the race organizers could use.

I think 2024 won't see me expanding my racing too much. I will probably still do a few through the summer, maybe a gravel event, and then try for more 'cross in the fall, especially the midweek stuff.

[^1]: My hardtail [Graymare](../graymare/) isn't great, but upgrading it would be really expensive for the amount and style of actual mountain biking I do.
[^2]: The races were [Tubs on Tubs](../tubsontubs2023), [Jim Horner](../jimhornergrandprix2023), [Hardcore Hop N Hurl](../hopnhurl2023) and the second day of [Baby Walter Cross](../babywaltercross-2).
[^3]: In their system lower is better. The best in the world have a rating under 100.
[^4]: Both of my bad races involved steep sketchy downhills I wasn't confident in riding at all. Looks like this is what I'll be working on for 2024.
[^5]: In cyclocross you get to start closer to the front of the race if you have more points/a better ranking. This makes a difference so you don't get stuck behind crashes or slowpokes right off the hop.
