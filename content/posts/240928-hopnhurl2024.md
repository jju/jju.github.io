The first time I [raced CX in Devon](../puncheurcross2022), I loved it. [Last year](../hopnhurl2023/) I was injured beforehand so it turned out to be my worst race of the season, but it was still such a good course it was hard to really be down on it. This year I wasn't hurt and just came in to have a good time.

Part of what makes Devon a fun course is the variety of terrain. Races at [Capilano](../capilanopark/) are grass grass grass (with a few roots on the 50m of singletrack), but at Voyageur Park you've got grass and dirt and pavement and a beach and sand, all in the leaves changing colour, so it's nice. Different terrain also forces the racers into different choices. I was watching the Sport Men mostly from the sand pit while kibitzing with a few more experienced racers. There was a choice to make there over whether to try riding the sand or to pick up your bike and run. When I was watching most people were running it. I tried to ride it on my preride, but with the hairpin coming in, it just wasn't worth it. If you could stay on, you'd have a better chance of also riding up the short uphill right after the pit, but more people I saw put their bikes down then rode up after smoother remounts than I'm capable of.

![Choosing a line.](/hopnhurl24_downhill_sportmen.jpg "Line Choice")[^2]

Another choice was the downhill pictured above. There was -- to my view -- a choice between two lines from the top (which you reached via a steep runup):
	a) straight down the steep dirt with a sharp right-hander on the paved bike path at the bottom, or
	b) turning right on the dirt about a quarter way down to ride a narrower chute that came straight out onto the bike path.
In pre-ride I took the straight down path because of a root in the middle of the descent and I felt it was more manageable. But once I was actually chasing people, I went for the right hand path even though we were starting to tear up the ground making it more treacherous to get into it. In the end I managed it all right (and also cut off one of my competitors going into it, which got me a gap), which was so much better than last year's panic attack at the top of that hill[^3].

[^3]:Afterwards, my clubmate and Expert Men 'crosser Jason told me I should have taken the grass over for the entirely straight shot through to the right. I had been following the dirt path, but as Franky told me, "anything between the tape is fair game for riding over." That would have been a smoother line and easier. But now I know for next year.

Later in the course there was another choice between a steeper and a slightly more roundabout climb. I took the less steep way, mostly to get a bit of recovery. But all in all the number of choices available are what make this course my favourite. Next year I'll try and arrange my time so I do both races of the weekend instead of just one.
